# BBC Programmes (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the BBC Programmes knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-05-04. Dataset: BBC Programmes (KG id: bbc-programmes)

Overall Summary  
The BBC Programmes knowledge graph is  a large dataset (60 million triples) with some strengths in metadata availability, machine-readable licensing, and FAIR compliance signals (F, A, R components above 0.7). However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely constrains evaluation and usage: many critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, Conciseness, Interoperability) cannot be measured and score 0\. Although an RDF dump is declared available in metadata, no download URL could be verified, and no accepted RDF media type was detected. As a result, the overall normalized quality score is very low: 11.24 out of 100\.

Key Takeaways and Recommendations

- Restore or provide a working SPARQL endpoint, or at minimum publish a verifiable RDF dump with accepted RDF media types (e.g., application/n-triples, application/ld+json, text/turtle) and stable download URLs.  
- Expose HTTPS support and access/authentication details to improve Security and FAIR A1.2.  
- Publish VoID/DCAT with explicit serialization formats and language tags to raise Versatility and Interoperability.  
- Add human-readable license documentation and publisher/author details in metadata pages to strengthen Licensing and Verifiability.  
- Once access is operational, re-run automated checks to populate Consistency, Accuracy, Conciseness, and Performance metrics.

# BPR – Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the BPR – Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies knowledge graph (KG id: bpr), based on the report from 2025-05-04. Overall Summary The BPR KG exposes a working SPARQL endpoint and a large catalog of downloadable RDF/CSV dumps, with HTTPS support and no authentication required. It achieves strong FAIR Accessibility and good Findability, and shows solid results on intrinsic conciseness and accuracy checks. However, dereferenceability is zero, interlinking is minimal, metadata languages and serialization mediatypes are not provided, and understandability is limited (few labels, no vocabularies reported). Consistency is mixed due to an ontology hijacking alert. The dataset appears current in terms of last-modified metadata but provides no declared update frequency. Overall normalized quality score: 40.1 out of 100\. Number of triples (metadata): 366,800.

# dblp (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the dblp Knowledge Graph (KG id: dblp-kg), based on the report from 2025-05-04.  
Overall Summary  
The dblp Knowledge Graph is a very large, actively synchronized scholarly dataset with an operational SPARQL endpoint and excellent performance. It provides machine-readable CC0 licensing and clear source and contact information, yielding very strong FAIR scores (3.45/4). Strengths include high dereferenceability (0.9), extremely large scale (≈1.335B triples via query), and near-perfect intrinsic accuracy and conciseness. However, overall quality is moderated by very weak interlinking to external datasets, limited representational understandability (few labels relative to total triples, no vocabularies list), incomplete metadata for dynamicity (no last-modified or update frequency reported), and mixed signals on security (HTTPS not detected by metric; no authentication). The normalized overall quality score is 43.2 out of 100\.

# Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-05-04. Overall Summary  
This dataset provides bathing water quality assessment data for England and Wales from the Environment Agency. It offers a working SPARQL endpoint with HTTPS, no authentication requirements, dereferenceable URIs, and a machine-readable Open Government Licence. Performance is acceptable (median latency \~319 ms; \~4 req/s). It scores very highly on intrinsic Accuracy and Conciseness and has strong FAIR scores overall (3.77/4). Weaknesses include a very low interlinking score, limited understandability (only \~4.86% of triples carry labels/comments), a consistency flag due to an ontology hijacking issue, missing multi-language indications, and no concrete download URLs despite metadata asserting an RDF dump is available. The normalized quality score is 45.45 out of 100\.

Notes

- Although metadata indicates an RDF dump is available and downloadable, no concrete download URLs were found via query or metadata links at the time of assessment.  
- Average URI length for objects exceeds the recommended \<80 characters threshold; subjects are borderline; predicates are within recommended length.  
- The presence of an ontology hijacking problem reduces the consistency score despite other consistency sub-metrics being strong.

# LiLa Lemma Bank (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the LiLa Lemma Bank knowledge graph (KG id: LemmaBank), based on the report from 2025-05-04.  
Overall Summary  
LiLa Lemma Bank is a mid-sized dataset (about 1.70 million triples) that shows good Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability (FAIR) signals in the metadata: it declares a machine-readable CC BY-SA license, provides a working access point to a data dump (via GitHub), and includes contact/source information. It also reports interlinks to other datasets. However, the lack of a confirmed working SPARQL endpoint for this specific dataset prevents the assessment of many critical data-quality dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.), and several representational aspects are not documented. As a result, the normalized quality score remains low at 12.1 out of 100\. The availability and format of the RDF dump could also be improved (no commonly accepted RDF media type recorded in the metadata).

# Coronavirus dataset (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Coronavirus dataset (KG id: micro-coronavirus), based on the report from 2025-05-04. Overall Summary The Coronavirus dataset is a large knowledge graph with approximately 80.9 million triples (70.9M stated in metadata). It offers a working SPARQL endpoint and strong licensing metadata, and achieves high scores in accuracy, intrinsic conciseness, interpretability (few modeling anti-patterns), and FAIR (overall 3.19/4). However, the absence of an RDF dump and low HTTPS/security features limit accessibility. Interlinking and metadata versatility are weak (few declared vocabularies, no alternate serializations, no update frequency), and there are notable consistency issues (including ontology hijacking flags). Overall normalized quality score: 46.06 out of 100 (score: 0.461).

Notes and gaps observed

- No RDF dump is available (metadata and endpoint checks), and no download URLs are provided.  
- Security is weak (no HTTPS, no authentication), although SPARQL is reachable.  
- Interlinking is minimal despite a high number of sameAs chains; SKOS mapping properties are absent.  
- Very limited declared vocabularies and serializations; language metadata is absent and language query timed out.  
- Consistency checks flag ontology hijacking and potential schema misuse, despite perfect scores on several accuracy checks.

# NoiPA (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the NoiPA knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-05-04.  
Overall Summary  
NoiPA is a very large knowledge graph (≈412.9 million triples by query; 340 million by metadata) with a working SPARQL endpoint. It shows strong performance (fast latency, good throughput), robust Intrinsic quality (high Accuracy and Conciseness), and good Trust/FAIR metadata (machine-readable licenses, publisher info, VoID/DCAT usage). However, dereferenceability is 0, inter-dataset linking is effectively absent (degree 0), and representational versatility is weak (no languages or serializations advertised in metadata, no accepted media type detected by the checker). RDF dumps are not detected as available via metadata, and the dump status via query is flagged as offline, despite many distribution URLs being listed. Overall normalized quality score: 52.477 out of 100 (overall score 0.525).

Notes

- Several distribution URLs are listed, yet RDF dump availability tests indicate “missing/offline.”  
- HTTPS support is flagged as False in the security metric, though the endpoint URL is HTTPS.  
- Interlinking indicators are near zero despite a large count of owl:sameAs chains; this suggests limited outbound links to external datasets.

# Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-05-04. Overall Summary  
Allie provides a very large knowledge graph (≈303.1 million triples observed via query; ≈94.4 million declared in metadata) with an online SPARQL endpoint and strong FAIR scores. Accessibility, licensing, security, accuracy, and conciseness are strong. However, interlinking is extremely weak, consistency issues are flagged (including ontology hijacking), and representational versatility and understandability are low. Metadata lacks update/maintenance signals, giving poor timeliness. Despite the robust FAIR profile, the overall normalized quality score is low: 9.992 out of 100\. Improving interlinking, publishing working dump links, clarifying update cadence, and addressing consistency issues would markedly raise quality.

- Improve interlinking to other datasets (increase degree and centrality) and provide explicit SKOS mappings where appropriate.  
- Address consistency issues (ontology hijacking and schema misuse) and document vocabulary usage.  
- Enhance metadata with modification dates and update frequency; expand language tags and serialization format declarations.  
- Reduce reliance on blank nodes where possible and increase labeling coverage to improve understandability.

# WordNet 2.0 (W3C) (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the WordNet 2.0 (W3C) knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-05-04.  
Overall Summary  
WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a medium-sized RDF dataset (about 710,000 triples) with good metadata and strong FAIR sub-scores, especially Reusability (1.0) and solid Findability/Accessibility/Interoperability signals. It provides a machine-readable Apache 2.0 license and indicates accepted RDF media types. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely limits verifiability of many metrics and prevents measurement of operational qualities (performance, security) and in-data checks (consistency, accuracy). Although an RDF dump is marked as available in metadata, no download URL was discovered. Overall, the dataset attains a low normalized quality score of 13.3 out of 100\.

# CIDOC-CRM (2025-05-04)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the CIDOC-CRM knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-05-04.  
Overall Summary  
CIDOC-CRM presents strong conceptual documentation and reputation within cultural heritage but, from a data-access standpoint, the assessed knowledge graph lacks essential access points: there is no SPARQL endpoint and no downloadable RDF dump indicated in metadata. Licensing is not provided, and most representational, intrinsic, and contextual metrics cannot be computed. FAIR results are mixed: Findability is relatively good due to DOI and registration in search engines, and Reusability benefits from VoID/DCAT predicates and publisher info presence signals; however, Accessibility and Interoperability remain low without a working access point or interlinks. The normalized quality score is 9.575 out of 100\.

  - Description: The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is a theoretical and practical tool for information integration in the field of cultural heritage. It can help researchers, administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.

Notes and implications

- No operational access point is available (no SPARQL endpoint, no RDF dump), which blocks most technical quality checks and depresses Accessibility, Performance, and Security scores.  
- Licensing is missing, lowering Reusability and legal clarity.  
- FAIR findings suggest good registration and DOI presence for findability and some metadata structured with VoID/DCAT, but without data access and interlinks, the practical utility is limited.

# BBC Programmes (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the BBC Programmes knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-06-01.  
Overall Summary  
The BBC Programmes knowledge graph is a large dataset (60 million triples) with strong Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) scores. It excels in providing metadata, a machine-readable license, and publisher information. However, its overall quality is severely hampered by the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint. This leads to zero scores across numerous critical dimensions, including Performance, Security, Consistency, and Accuracy, resulting in a very low normalized quality score of 11.2 out of 100\. While an RDF dump is reported as available in metadata, its discoverability (no download links retrieved) and media types could be improved.

# BPR – Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the “BPR – Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali” knowledge graph (KG id: bpr), based on the report from 2025-06-01.  
Overall Summary  
BPR is a medium-sized linked open data asset (≈366,800 triples per metadata) with an operational SPARQL endpoint and extensive downloadable dumps. It scores strongly on Security (HTTPS, no auth), Currency (recently maintained), Conciseness, and FAIR principles overall (FAIR aggregate 3.57). Performance is acceptable for an open endpoint. However, dereferenceability is 0.0 and interlinking is minimal (degree 1), while metadata language coverage, serialization format diversity, and human-readable licensing are weak. Understandability is low (few/no labels), interpretability is not evidenced, and some consistency warnings exist (ontology hijacking flagged). Timeliness is unreported (no update frequency). The normalized quality score is 40.12 out of 100\.

    The BPR \- Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali (Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies) is a database of bibliographic references of books and articles in periodical journals addressing the history of the Italian Parliament and the history of elections. In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  
    - the Italian Parliament, from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848, the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;  
    - elections (laws, procedures, results), with reference to general elections as from 1848\.  
      The BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  
      Each bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  
      The BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers, it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs, judgements, articles from periodicals, contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.

Notes and quick recommendations

- Improve dereferenceability of HTTP URIs (currently 0.0) to boost Findability and Integrability.  
- Publish/update interlinking and mapping information (SKOS mapping, links to external KGs) to raise Interlinking and Completeness.  
- Expose update timestamps and frequency to strengthen Currency/Timeliness.  
- Clarify HTTPS support (checker reported False) and provide a human-readable license page to round out Accessibility/Licensing.  
- Consider publishing a concise list of used vocabularies and more labels to improve Understandability.

# Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality  (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-06-01.  
Overall Summary  
The dataset provides bathing water quality assessment data for England and Wales, exposed via a working SPARQL endpoint and backed by strong security (HTTPS, no auth required), excellent Intrinsic quality (near-perfect Accuracy and Conciseness), and very high FAIR scores (F, A, R all 1.0; I is 0.77). Performance is moderate with low latency and modest throughput. Availability is generally good, with machine-readable licensing and dereferenceable URIs; however, no working RDF dump links were discovered via queries despite metadata indicating availability, and language/serialization versatility is limited. Interlinking completeness is low, and several consistency red flags (e.g., ontology hijacking and undefined terms) reduce the Consistency score. Overall normalized quality score: 45.45 out of 100\.

Notes and Recommendations

- Make RDF dump links easily discoverable and verifiably online (current metadata indicates availability, but no links are found via queries).  
- Provide a human-readable license statement in the documentation.  
- Improve representational versatility: publish dataset in multiple serialization formats and provide language-tagged literals where applicable.  
- Address consistency issues: investigate ontology hijacking signals and ensure all classes/properties used are properly declared; resolve “misplaced property/class” detections.  
- Increase interlinking and mapping properties (e.g., SKOS mappings) to improve Interlinking and Completeness.  
- Consider documenting update frequency to improve Timeliness.

# LiLa Lemma Bank (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the LiLa Lemma Bank knowledge graph (KG id: LemmaBank), based on the report from 2025-06-01. Overall Summary  
LiLa Lemma Bank contains about 1,699,687 triples. It shows relatively strong FAIR results for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability thanks to explicit metadata, a machine-readable CC BY-SA license, and publisher/source information. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely hampers overall quality: many critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) cannot be measured and score zero. Interlinking indicators are present in metadata (degree 21), but with the endpoint unavailable, several interlinking checks remain unassessed and the interlinking score is 0.0. An RDF dump is indicated as available via GitHub, but no commonly accepted RDF media type is advertised. The overall normalized quality score is 12.08 out of 100\.

# Coronavirus dataset (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Coronavirus dataset knowledge graph (KG id: micro-coronavirus), based on the report from 2025-06-01. Overall Summary The Coronavirus dataset provides a working SPARQL endpoint with very high URI dereferenceability, complete licensing information, and strong intrinsic data quality (perfect Accuracy and near-perfect Conciseness). FAIR scores are overall strong (F=0.94, A=1.0, I=0.5, R=0.75; total 3.19). Performance is moderate and the graph is sizable (≈80.9M triples reported by query). However, there is no downloadable RDF dump advertised or found, HTTPS is not supported, Understandability is very low (few labels relative to triples), Interlinking quality is effectively negligible, and dataset dynamicity (currency/timeliness) is not documented. Ontology hijacking is flagged. The normalized overall quality score is 46.06 out of 100\.

Overall Quality

- Score: 0.461  
- Normalized score: 46.055 out of 100

Key takeaways and recommendations

- Keep the SPARQL endpoint online; it is a major strength. Improve performance if feasible.  
- Publish and advertise an RDF dump in a standard RDF serialization with a commonly accepted media type; this will improve Availability, Versatility, and Reusability.  
- Enable HTTPS on the endpoint for better Security and FAIR A1.2 alignment.  
- Improve Understandability by increasing rdfs:label/rdfs:comment coverage and documenting vocabularies used; add SPARQL example queries.  
- Address the Ontology hijacking flag and validate schema usage to further raise the Consistency score.  
- Document update policies and last-modified dates to improve Currency/Timeliness.  
- Strengthen interlinking quality (e.g., add SKOS mapping properties, improve external links) to move the Interlinking score beyond near-zero.

# NoiPA (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the NoiPA knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-06-01. Overall Summary NoiPA is a very large public-sector knowledge graph (about 419 million triples by query, 340 million by metadata) with a working SPARQL endpoint and excellent measured performance. It provides machine-readable licensing and clear publisher information, and it reports update frequency (annual). However, it shows weak interlinking to external datasets (degree 0, centrality 0\) and URIs are not dereferenceable (0.0). Representational versatility is poor (no declared serialization formats or media types in metadata, and dumps reported as missing/offline by the metrics despite many dataset landing pages), and HTTPS is reported as not used by the endpoint (security score \= 0.5). Intrinsic accuracy and conciseness are very high, but consistency is moderate due to ontology-hijacking warnings and undefined terms flags. Understandability is low, with labels on only 8.06% of triples. Overall, the normalized quality score is 52.48 out of 100\.

# Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-06-01. Overall Summary Allie is a large, actively served biomedical KG with an operational SPARQL endpoint and roughly 303 million triples. It shows strong FAIR performance (F=0.98, A=1.0, I=0.88, R=1.0; FAIR total 3.86), excellent licensing, security (HTTPS), and very high intrinsic quality (near-perfect accuracy and strong conciseness). Notable weaknesses include extremely low interlinking to external datasets, moderate consistency risks (ontology hijacking flagged), relatively low understandability (only 2.15% of triples carry labels/comments), and heavy use of blank nodes. Despite metadata indicating monthly updates, no modification timestamp could be retrieved. The overall normalized quality score is 56.5 out of 100 (Score: 0.565).

Notable strengths

- Operational SPARQL endpoint with HTTPS and reasonable performance.  
- Strong licensing and FAIR compliance; publisher information provided.  
- Very high intrinsic accuracy and strong data conciseness.  
- Large, rich dataset with clear domain-specific ontology (Allie).

Key issues to address

- Extremely weak interlinking to the broader LOD cloud despite many sameAs chains and SKOS mappings.  
- Moderate consistency concerns (ontology hijacking flagged).  
- Low understandability (low proportion of labeled triples).  
- Heavy reliance on blank nodes, which can hinder data reuse.  
- Missing explicit modification timestamps despite monthly update claims.  
- No working download links discovered, although dumps are indicated as available in metadata.

# WordNet 2.0 (W3C) (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the WordNet 2.0 (W3C) knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-06-01.  
Overall Summary  
WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a relatively small dataset (710,000 triples) that shows strong Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability (FAIR) sub-scores thanks to clear metadata, a machine-readable license (Apache 2.0), registration in search engines, and use of standard RDF/OWL formats. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely limits measurable quality: many dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) score zero because they cannot be assessed. While an RDF dump is indicated as online and common media types are listed, no actual download URLs were discovered in the metadata. Overall, the dataset has a low normalized quality score of 12.1 out of 100\.

# CIDOC-CRM (2025-06-01)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the CIDOC-CRM knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-06-01.  
Overall Summary  
CIDOC-CRM is a well-known cultural heritage ontology. In this evaluation, its overall quality is constrained by the absence of a SPARQL endpoint, missing licensing information, and a lack of machine-readable RDF distribution details. Although metadata indicates an RDF dump should be available, no download URL was discovered and only a generic HTML media type is advertised. Interlinking is absent, and most content-dependent metrics cannot be computed. The dataset reports 0 triples in metadata (typical for a pure ontology landing page without an exposed dump in scope of the scan). The normalized quality score is 9.6 out of 100\. FAIR indicators show relatively good Findability (persistent identifiers and search engine registration) and partial Accessibility, but Interoperability and Reusability are limited by missing standard formats and licensing.

  - Description: The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is a theoretical and practical tool for information integration in the field of cultural heritage. It can help researchers, administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.

# BBC Programmes (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the BBC Programmes knowledge graph (KG id: bbc-programmes; KG name: BBC Programmes), based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary The BBC Programmes knowledge graph is a large dataset (60 million triples) with relatively strong FAIR sub-scores for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability thanks to available metadata, a machine-readable CC-BY license, registration in searchable engines, and VoID/DCAT descriptions. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely degrades critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, and most Representational metrics), leading to a very low normalized quality score of 9.99 out of 100 (overall score 0.10/1). An RDF dump is flagged as available in metadata, but no actual download links were discovered, and no supported RDF media types were confirmed.

Key takeaways and recommendations

- Restore or provide a working SPARQL endpoint; most missing or zero-valued dimensions depend on it.  
- Publish actual RDF dump download links and ensure at least one common RDF media type (e.g., Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML) is available.  
- Add a human-readable license page and explicit publisher/contributor metadata in VoID/DCAT.  
- Expose security details (HTTPS, authentication) and basic performance characteristics once an endpoint is online.  
- Provide vocabulary lists, label/comment coverage, and examples to improve understandability and reuse.

# BPR – Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the BPR – Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali (KG id: bpr), based on the report from 2025-07-13.  
Overall Summary  
The BPR knowledge graph is a very large dataset (≈352 million triples via SPARQL; metadata declares 366.8k) with a working SPARQL endpoint and many downloadable RDF dumps. It scores highly on Security (HTTPS, no auth), Intrinsic Accuracy and Conciseness, and shows strong Interoperability and near-perfect Interpretability. However, it has critical weaknesses: dereferenceability is 0, interlinking is minimal, and metadata versatility is limited (no declared serialization formats or media types, and language detection via query timed out). The update frequency is not stated and timeliness scores 0, despite last modification being 2024-02-08. Overall normalized quality score is 50.7 out of 100\.

Key takeaways and recommendations

- Keep the SPARQL endpoint healthy; consider adding HTTPS on the endpoint URL itself (an https variant) if available.  
- Improve dereferenceability (URIs currently score 0.0).  
- Enrich metadata: declare serialization formats and valid media types; publish language tags in metadata and data.  
- Publish update frequency; current timeliness score is 0\.  
- Strengthen interlinking beyond sameAs chains; add SKOS mapping properties to improve discoverability and reuse.  
- Investigate and mitigate the “Ontology hijacking” finding.

# dblp (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the dblp Knowledge Graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary  
The dblp Knowledge Graph is a very large dataset (about 1.45 billion triples) with a working SPARQL endpoint and downloadable RDF dumps. It achieves excellent Availability and Performance, provides machine-readable CC0 licensing, and scores very high on Intrinsic Accuracy and Conciseness. FAIR compliance is strong overall (FAIR score 3.46/4), with perfect scores for Accessibility and Reusability sub-principles. However, security is only moderate (no HTTPS confirmed in the Accessibility/Security metrics), Understandability is low despite many labels, dynamicity information is missing (no creation/modification dates or update frequency), and interlinking metrics are largely absent (very low Interlinking score) even though many owl:sameAs chains exist. The normalized overall quality score is 43.2 out of 100\.

# Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13.  
Overall Summary  
This dataset contains about 8.74 million triples and is provided by a highly trusted public authority. It has strong FAIR Reusability and good Findability/Interoperability driven by clear metadata, a machine-readable Open Government Licence, VoID/DCAT use, and registration in search engines. However, the lack of a working access point (SPARQL is marked as missing and no RDF dump is available for download) severely impacts Accessibility as well as many intrinsic and operational dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy), which remain unassessed and score zero. Interlinking is present but minimal. The overall normalized quality score is 11.24 out of 100\.

# LiLa Lemma Bank (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the LiLa Lemma Bank knowledge graph (KG id: LemmaBank), based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary LiLa Lemma Bank is a modestly sized linked data resource (about 1.70 million triples) underpinning the LiLa Knowledge Base’s interlinking of Latin lexical resources. It achieves strong FAIR sub-scores for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability thanks to rich metadata, a machine-readable license, and publisher/source details. However, the SPARQL endpoint appears missing or offline, so most query-based checks could not be performed. This results in zero scores across many critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) and a low normalized quality score of 12.1 out of 100\. An RDF dump is indicated as available via GitHub, but no commonly accepted RDF media type is detected in the metadata, limiting reuse.

Overall Quality

- Overall score: 0.121  
- Normalized score: 12.077 (≈12.1 out of 100\)

Key takeaways and recommendations

- Restore or provide a working SPARQL endpoint. This single improvement would enable measurement (and likely improvement) across Performance, Security, Representational, Intrinsic, and Dynamicity dimensions.  
- Publish an RDF dump in a commonly accepted RDF serialization (e.g., Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML) and declare its media type in metadata to improve Interoperability/Versatility and the FAIR I1-D subprinciple.  
- Expose human-readable licensing information alongside the machine-readable license.  
- Provide language tags, vocabulary usage, labels/comments counts, and examples in metadata or via SPARQL to boost Understandability.  
- Add update frequency and last-modified dates to improve Currency/Timeliness.

# Coronavirus dataset (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Coronavirus dataset knowledge graph (KG id: micro-coronavirus), based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary  
The Coronavirus dataset is a large knowledge graph (\~81 million triples by query; \~71 million by metadata) with a working SPARQL endpoint and strong scores for Licensing, Accuracy, Conciseness, Interpretability, and FAIR principles (overall FAIR score: 3.19 out of 4). The endpoint performs moderately (median latency \~0.533 s; throughput \~2 req/s) and URIs are largely dereferenceable (0.9686). However, the absence of an RDF dump and of declared serialization formats or media types, no HTTPS, very limited interlinking, low understandability (only 9.1% of triples have labels), and missing update/currency information lower overall quality. The normalized overall quality score is 46.1 out of 100\.

Key Takeaways and Recommended Improvements

- Publish an RDF dump with a common RDF media type (e.g., application/ld+json, text/turtle) and advertise serialization formats to boost Versatility and FAIR I1-D/R1.3-D.  
- Enable HTTPS on the SPARQL endpoint to improve Security (and align A1.2).  
- Increase interlinking to external datasets (sameAs and SKOS mappings) to improve Interlinking, Completeness, and FAIR I3-D.  
- Improve documentation and understandability: add labels/comments for more entities, provide vocabularies used, and examples of SPARQL queries.  
- Provide currency metadata (creation/modification dates, update frequency) to improve Dynamicity.

# NoiPA (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the NoiPA knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary NoiPA provides a working SPARQL endpoint and a very large graph (≈433M triples by query; 340M by metadata). Accessibility and Performance are decent overall, and Reusability (license, publisher) is clearly stated. However, Interlinking to external datasets is essentially absent (degree 0), URIs are not dereferenceable (0.0), and Security is only partial (no HTTPS detected by the checks, no authentication). Representational versatility is weak: no languages or serialization formats advertised in metadata, and the dump availability checks report “missing/offline” despite many advertised download URLs. Understandability is low (labels on 8.09% of triples), while Intrinsic Accuracy and Conciseness are very high. Consistency is mixed and flags an ontology hijacking issue, leading to a moderate consistency score. Overall normalized quality score: 52.474 out of 100\.

# Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary Allie is a large life-sciences KG with an operational SPARQL endpoint and multiple RDF media types, leading to very strong FAIR scores (3.88/4) and high marks for Accessibility, Security, Accuracy, and Conciseness. Licensing and publisher information are clearly provided and machine-readable. Performance is acceptable (median latency \~539 ms, 2 req/s). Weak points include extremely low interlinking (Degree=1, near-zero centrality), modest understandability, and consistency issues flagged by an ontology hijacking problem. Despite a “Monthly” update frequency in metadata, the creation date is old (2011-08-01) and no modification date is retrievable. Overall normalized quality score: 56.6 out of 100\.

# WordNet 2.0 (W3C) (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the WordNet 2.0 (W3C) knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13.  
Overall Summary  
WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a modest-sized dataset (about 710 thousand triples) with a strong FAIR profile thanks to an accessible RDF dump, standard RDF media types, and a machine-readable Apache 2.0 license. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint prevents measurement of many important dimensions (Performance, Security, Intrinsic, and most Representational metrics), and depresses the overall normalized quality score to 12.1 out of 100\. Interlinking metadata indicates connections to 12 other datasets, but interlinking completeness is 0.0 and no SKOS mappings could be verified. Verifiability is moderate due to the presence of sources and some author metadata, believability is high, and reputation (PageRank) is low.

Notes and Recommendations

- Provide a working SPARQL endpoint (or clearly document permanent download URLs) to enable measurement of Performance, Security, Intrinsic, and Representational metrics and to improve Availability beyond 0.5.  
- Publish explicit download links to the RDF dump in the metadata to remove ambiguity and strengthen Availability.  
- Add human-readable licensing information and publisher/contributor details to improve Licensing and Verifiability.  
- Indicate languages, vocabularies used, and label coverage in the metadata or via a SPARQL endpoint to improve Representational metrics.  
- Consider adding SKOS mapping assertions and documenting interlinks to raise Interlinking completeness.

# CIDOC-CRM (2025-07-13)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the CIDOC-CRM knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary CIDOC-CRM is a widely used conceptual model in cultural heritage. In this assessment, however, it behaves more like a website/ontology page than an operational knowledge graph service. There is no SPARQL endpoint, no exposed download URL for an RDF dump, and no machine- or human-readable license detected. Interlinking and most data-driven checks cannot be performed. Despite that, the dataset scores relatively well on believability and some FAIR F- and A-subprinciples due to metadata presence and discoverability. Overall quality is low, with a normalized score of 9.6 out of 100\.

  - Description: The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is a theoretical and practical tool for information integration in the field of cultural heritage. It can help researchers, administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.

# BBC Programmes (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the BBC Programmes knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03.  
Overall Summary  
The BBC Programmes knowledge graph is a large dataset (60,000,000 triples) with moderate FAIR performance: Findability and Accessibility are helped by rich metadata and a machine-readable CC-BY license, and the dataset is registered in search engines. However, the lack of a working SPARQL endpoint severely hampers overall quality, driving zero scores across critical dimensions like Performance, Security, Consistency, Conciseness, Accuracy, and most Representational metrics. Although an RDF dump is declared available in metadata, no download URL was discovered and no commonly accepted RDF media type is indicated. The normalized quality score is 9.992 out of 100\.

# BPR – Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and electoral studies (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the BPR – Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and electoral studies knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03. Overall Summary The BPR graph is large and actively served via a working SPARQL endpoint over HTTPS with no authentication. It offers many downloadable RDF dumps and shows strong results in Accuracy, Security, Interpretability, and Currency. FAIR scores are high for Accessibility and Reusability, moderate for Findability and Interoperability. Main weaknesses are very limited interlinking (degree 1, centrality \~0), zero URI dereferenceability, sparse metadata for verifiability (missing authors/publishers), low timeliness metadata (no stated update frequency), and modest understandability (only 8.63% of triples with labels). Overall quality score is 0.507 (normalized 50.732 out of 100).

# dblp (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the dblp Knowledge Graph (KG id: dblp-kg), based on the report from 2025-08-03.  
Overall Summary  
The dblp Knowledge Graph is a very large and operational dataset (\~1.45 billion triples via SPARQL) with a working SPARQL endpoint and good performance. It provides machine-readable CC0 licensing and multiple download links, and achieves strong FAIR scores (overall FAIR score: 3.46). Strengths include Availability, Performance, Accuracy, Conciseness, and Interoperability. However, several aspects limit the overall normalized quality score (43.2 out of 100): dynamicity is not machine-verified (no currency/timeliness evidence), interlinking metrics are largely unavailable or extremely low despite many sameAs chains, security is only partial, and understandability remains low despite a large number of labels. There are also notable consistency warnings (ontology hijacking detected, and signals of misplacement/undefined term usage), although accuracy-oriented checks score maximally.

Overall Scores

- Score: 0.432  
- Normalized score: 43.213

Observations and Recommendations

- Access and performance are strong: the SPARQL endpoint is available and responsive, and data dumps are listed in metadata with accepted media types. Consider ensuring the endpoint or metadata explicitly reflects HTTPS usage to align the security metric, or adjust the metric computation if already using HTTPS.  
- Dynamicity signals in prose (daily sync) are not machine-verified; expose modification timestamps, creation age, and update frequency in VoID/DCAT to raise Currency/Timeliness.  
- Interlinking metrics are largely missing or near-zero despite many sameAs chains. Publish explicit inter-dataset links and SKOS mapping properties, and ensure their discoverability to raise the Interlinking score (and FAIR I3-D).  
- Understandability is low despite many labels; improve coverage of rdfs:label/comment, provide examples, and document vocabularies used.  
- Consistency warnings (ontology hijacking detected; signals of misplacement/undefined terms) should be investigated; publishing and validating the schema, and ensuring proper term declarations, will improve Consistency.  
- Maintain strong Accuracy and Conciseness practices; these are standout strengths for dblp KG.

# Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03.  
Overall Summary  
The Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality knowledge graph contains 8,735,962 triples. It performs strongly on Trust (Believability) and has a clear machine-readable Open Government Licence. Some metadata elements and examples are available, and the dataset is modestly sized. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint (despite a known URL) and the lack of an online RDF dump severely degrade overall quality. As a result, key dimensions such as Availability, Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, and several Representational metrics could not be assessed and score zero. The normalized overall quality score is 11.243 out of 100\.

Overall Scores

- Overall quality score: 0.112  
- Normalized quality score: 11.243 out of 100

Notes and Key Takeaways

- The primary blocker is the missing/offline SPARQL endpoint; this cascades into zero or unassessed results across many critical dimensions (Availability, Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, Interoperability, and others).  
- No online RDF dump is available according to metadata, despite some media types being listed in metadata.  
- Strengths include a clear machine-readable Open Government Licence, strong believability/trust indicators, and the presence of examples in documentation.  
- FAIR scores are mixed: metadata is present and registered, but there is no working access point, no DOI for data, and no standard/open representation confirmed via data access.

# LiLa Lemma Bank (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the LiLa Lemma Bank knowledge graph (KG id: LemmaBank), based on the report from 2025-08-03. Overall Summary  
LiLa Lemma Bank is a medium-sized dataset (approximately 1.70 million triples) with moderate FAIR scores driven by good metadata, a machine-readable license (CC BY-SA), and publisher/source details. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely undermines core quality dimensions such as Performance, Security, Consistency, and Accuracy, and prevents verification of many data-intrinsic metrics. While a repository link for obtaining the data is available (GitHub), the metadata lacks clear RDF media types and serialization details. The overall normalized quality score is 12.1 out of 100\.

Notes

- Many metrics could not be computed due to the missing/offline SPARQL endpoint.  
- Although a GitHub URL is provided for download, metadata lacks explicit RDF serialization media types, and no supported media type was detected as “commonly accepted.”

# Coronavirus dataset (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Coronavirus dataset knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03.  
Overall Summary  
The micro-coronavirus knowledge graph provides a working SPARQL endpoint and a sizable corpus of roughly 81 million triples (≈71 million per metadata; ≈81 million via query). It performs well on several intrinsic dimensions (Accuracy and Conciseness are very high), has strong FAIR sub-scores overall (F=0.75, A=1.0, I=0.5, R=0.75; aggregate FAIR=3.0/4), and offers machine-readable licensing from both metadata and queries. However, the dataset lacks an accessible RDF dump and declared serialization/media types, has no declared update frequency or modification dates, uses no HTTPS, and shows very low interlinking and understandability (few labels relative to graph size, no declared vocabularies). Consistency shows mixed results due to detected ontology hijacking despite otherwise strong per-metric values. The normalized overall quality score is 46.052 out of 100 (raw 0.461).

# NoiPA (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the NoiPA knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03. Overall Summary  
NoiPA is a very large knowledge graph (\~440 million triples by query) with a working SPARQL endpoint and excellent performance. FAIR scores are solid overall (2.57/4), with strong Accessibility (A=1.0) and Reusability (R=0.75). Interoperability is moderate (I=0.25) due to missing standard/open media types and absent interlinking. Availability is mixed: while the SPARQL endpoint is online and many distribution URLs are listed, automated checks flag the RDF dump as missing/offline, and no common media type is confirmed. Trust is acceptable (Believability 0.75; Verifiability \~0.50) though external Reputation is very low. Intrinsic data quality is strong on Accuracy and Conciseness but weakened by Consistency issues (e.g., ontology hijacking detected). Normalized overall quality score: 52.47 out of 100\.

# Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03.  
Overall Summary  
Allie is a very large knowledge graph (≈309.3 million triples via query; ≈94.4 million in metadata) with a working HTTPS SPARQL endpoint, clear licensing, and excellent FAIR scores for Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Availability is good overall, though RDF dump links are not retrievable via query and none were found, despite being indicated in metadata. Performance is moderate. Representational conciseness is mixed (reasonable URI lengths, heavy use of blank nodes). Understandability is modest (about 2.15% of triples carry labels). Interlinking to external datasets is extremely low (degree 1, near-zero centrality), though many sameAs chains and SKOS mappings are present internally. Consistency is mixed due to a detected ontology hijacking issue, while accuracy and conciseness are excellent. Currency is limited (creation date 2011 with no modification date), but timeliness is strong (reported monthly updates). Overall normalized quality score: 56.6 out of 100\.

# WordNet 2.0 (W3C) (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the WordNet 2.0 (W3C) knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03.  
Overall Summary  
WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a medium-sized dataset (about 710,000 triples) that benefits from clear metadata, an explicit machine-readable license (Apache 2.0), and good FAIR scores for Accessibility, Interoperability, and especially Reusability. However, like many static RDF dumps without an online SPARQL endpoint, its operational quality is limited across several dimensions. The lack of a working SPARQL endpoint prevents checks for security, performance, consistency, accuracy, and many representational metrics, and also yields a zero Interlinking score despite being connected to 12 datasets at the metadata level. The overall normalized quality score is low: 12.08 out of 100\. An RDF dump is indicated as online and uses a common accepted media type (RDF/XML), but no concrete download link was extracted.

Notes and Recommendations

- Provide a working SPARQL endpoint to enable full assessment and dramatically improve scores for Security, Performance, Consistency, Accuracy, and several Representational metrics.  
- Publish concrete, stable download URLs for the RDF dump in the metadata.  
- Enrich metadata with languages, publisher, contributors, and update/modified timestamps to improve Dynamicity, Understandability, and Verifiability.  
- Consider publishing dereferenceable URIs and documenting interlinks (e.g., sameAs chains, SKOS mappings) to reflect the dataset’s actual interlinking and improve Interlinking and FAIR F1-D.

# CIDOC-CRM (2025-08-03)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the CIDOC-CRM knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03. Overall Summary CIDOC-CRM presents itself as an ontology for cultural heritage integration, but as a dataset it lacks a working SPARQL endpoint and exposes no measurable data via queries. While metadata claims an RDF dump is available and downloadable, no actual download URLs are provided and no RDF media type is advertised (only text/html). Licensing is not indicated. Interlinking signals are absent. A few trust-related signals are present (clear description and a dataset URL), yielding modest believability and verifiability scores. The overall normalized quality score is 9.6 out of 100 (raw score 0.096). The FAIR composite score is 2.03, driven by Findability and some Accessibility/Reusability metadata, but hampered by missing dereferenceable URIs, licensing, and interlinking.

  - Description: The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is a theoretical and practical tool for information integration in the field of cultural heritage. It can help researchers, administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.

# BBC Programmes (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the BBC Programmes knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
The BBC Programmes knowledge graph is a large dataset (60 million triples) with moderate-to-strong Accessibility and Reusability within the FAIR framework, and moderate Findability. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint cascades into zero scores across many critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.), capping the overall normalized quality score at 9.99 out of 100\. While an RDF dump is declared available in the metadata, no actual download links are provided and no commonly accepted RDF media type is indicated, which limits practical accessibility and interoperability.

# BPR – Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for “BPR – Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies” (KG id: bpr), based on the report from 2025-09-07. Overall Summary BPR is a very large knowledge graph (≈354.1M triples via SPARQL; 366.8K declared in metadata) with an operational SPARQL endpoint and an extensive catalog of downloadable RDF dumps. It achieves excellent Accessibility (FAIR A=1.0), strong Reusability (R=0.75), and perfect Intrinsic Accuracy (1.0). Security is sound (HTTPS supported, no authentication), and performance is acceptable (≈398 ms median latency; ≈3 req/s throughput). However, Interlinking is extremely weak (degree=1; clustering=0; centrality≈0), dereferenceability is 0.0, and Verifiability and Reputation are low. Representational Versatility and Understandability are only moderate due to lack of declared languages, missing serialization-format metadata, and sparse use of external vocabularies. Consistency is mixed: most checks score near-perfect, but an ontology hijacking issue is detected. Overall normalized quality score: 50.7 out of 100\.

# dblp (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the dblp Knowledge Graph (KG id: dblp-kg), based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
The dblp Knowledge Graph is a very large and actively curated dataset, with about 1.45 billion triples accessible via a working SPARQL endpoint. It scores highly on Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability (FAIR), provides clear machine‑readable CC0 licensing, and shows excellent performance. Accuracy and conciseness are strong. However, overall quality is limited by weak interlinking (per metadata), low dynamicity evidence (missing modification and update frequency signals), limited understandability (few labels relative to total triples and no vocabulary list), and consistency risks (ontology hijacking flagged). HTTPS support was not detected by the metric, and no authentication is required. The normalized quality score is 42.0 out of 100\.

# Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
The Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality graph contains about 8.74 million triples and achieves high Trust (Believability) but weak scores across most other dimensions due to a missing/offline SPARQL endpoint and no accessible RDF dump. Licensing is clearly stated (Open Government Licence), and FAIR metadata coverage is moderate, yielding an overall FAIR score of 2.36. However, the absence of a working access point leads to zero scores in Availability, Performance, Security, Consistency, Conciseness, and Accuracy, and limits evidence for Representational metrics. Interlinking exists at a low level (degree 3), and examples are provided, slightly improving Understandability. The normalized overall quality score is 11.24 out of 100\.

Overall Scores

- Overall quality score: 0.112  
- Normalized quality score: 11.243 out of 100

Notes and implications

- The declared SPARQL endpoint URL exists but is not confirmed operational; as a result, almost all data-dependent metrics are unassessed.  
- No working RDF dump is available via metadata (offline), despite metadata indicating RDF-related media types; this impedes Accessibility and Reusability.  
- Trust is strong due to a recognized provider and explicit source/contact, but Reputation is low (very small PageRank).  
- Minimal interlinking and no evidence of standardized data organization further constrain Interoperability and Reusability.  
- Providing a working SPARQL endpoint or a valid RDF dump (e.g., Turtle, N-Triples) over HTTPS, plus clearer publisher/authorship metadata, would substantially improve scores across multiple dimensions.

# LiLa Lemma Bank (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the LiLa Lemma Bank knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
LiLa Lemma Bank contains about 1.7 million triples and achieves relatively strong FAIR sub-scores for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability, with moderate Interoperability (F=0.82, A=0.75, I=0.50, R=0.75; total FAIR=2.82). A machine-readable CC BY-SA license and source/publisher information are provided in metadata, and a download location is listed. However, the assessment treats the SPARQL endpoint as missing/offline, which prevents measurement of many critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) and yields zero scores across them. Interlinking metrics are present in metadata, but the Interlinking score remains 0\. Overall normalized quality score: 12.1 out of 100\.

Notes

- Although a SPARQL URL exists in metadata ([https://lila-erc.eu/sparql/lila\_knowledge\_base/sparql](https://lila-erc.eu/sparql/lila_knowledge_base/sparql)), this assessment treated the endpoint as missing/offline, which prevents many checks and depresses multiple scores.  
- Improving access to a working SPARQL endpoint and publishing a standard RDF serialization (with a recognized media type) would immediately raise Performance, Security, Representational, and FAIR-I scores.

# Coronavirus dataset (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Coronavirus dataset knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
The Coronavirus dataset is a large-scale knowledge graph (approximately 81 million triples as queried; \~71 million by metadata) with a working SPARQL endpoint and high URI dereferenceability. It achieves strong marks for Licensing (machine- and human-readable licenses present), Accuracy, and Conciseness, and shows very good FAIR sub-scores for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability (FAIR sum: 3.0/4). However, the dataset lacks an RDF dump and any declared serialization formats, which harms Versatility and limits offline re-use. Interlinking is present but extremely weak overall despite many sameAs chains, and Representational Understandability is low (labels cover about 9.1% of triples and no vocabularies are exposed). Security is only partial (no HTTPS), dataset dynamicity cannot be assessed (no modification or update info), and an ontology hijacking issue is detected. The resulting normalized quality score is 46.1 out of 100\.

- Normalized score: 46.063 out of 100

Notes and recommendations

- Provide an RDF dump in a standard, widely accepted RDF serialization (e.g., Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML) and advertise it in metadata to improve Versatility and Reusability.  
- Enable HTTPS on the SPARQL endpoint to strengthen Security.  
- Publish VoID/DCAT metadata with declared vocabularies and improve label coverage to raise Understandability.  
- Increase interlinks to external datasets and provide SKOS mapping properties to improve Interlinking and Completeness.  
- Expose modification dates and update frequency to address Dataset Dynamicity.  
- Investigate and remedy the reported ontology hijacking issue.

# NoiPA (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the NoiPA knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
NoiPA is a very large public-sector knowledge graph with roughly 446 million triples (query-based count) and an online SPARQL endpoint. It features strong performance, solid provenance and licensing signals, and extensive publisher information. However, Findability and Interoperability are constrained by non-dereferenceable URIs and limited interlinking to external datasets. Metadata and dumps are inconsistently exposed: although many dataset download links exist (CSV and RDF), RDF dump availability is reported as missing/offline in both metadata- and query-based checks. Representational versatility and understandability are weak (few formats declared, no common media type confirmed, low share of labeled triples). Overall, the dataset achieves a normalized quality score of 52.47 out of 100\.

# Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
Allie is a large life-science terminology dataset (94.4 million triples) with a clear machine-readable license and some helpful documentation elements (e.g., examples). However, the absence of a working access point (SPARQL endpoint offline/missing and no RDF dump available) critically impairs accessibility, performance, security, and most intrinsic checks. Interlinking is minimal, and many representational and dynamicity metrics cannot be assessed. The resulting normalized quality score is 9.992 out of 100, driven mainly by license/publisher metadata, dataset size, and FAIR metadata presence, but held back by lack of operational access and limited interlinking and interoperability.

Overall Quality

- Overall score: 0.10/1  
- Normalized quality score: 9.992/100

Key takeaways and recommendations

- Provide at least one working access point: restore/enable the SPARQL endpoint or publish a downloadable RDF dump.  
- Expose update and modification metadata (creation/last-modified dates, update frequency) to improve dynamicity metrics.  
- Increase interlinking to other datasets and document vocabularies used to improve interoperability and reputation.  
- Publish human-readable licensing and basic publisher/author metadata to strengthen verifiability and reuse.  
- If a dump is provided, use a commonly accepted RDF media type and advertise it alongside VoID/DCAT descriptors.

# WordNet 2.0 (W3C) (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the WordNet 2.0 (W3C) knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a medium-sized knowledge graph (about 0.71 million triples) with good FAIR characteristics driven by an online RDF dump, standard/open formats, and a clear machine-readable license. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint prevents assessment across many important dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) and drags down the overall quality. The normalized quality score is 12.08 out of 100 (overall score 0.121). Interlinking signals exist in the metadata (degree of connection 12), but without a queryable endpoint, deeper link quality cannot be verified.

# CIDOC-CRM (2025-09-07)

This is a detailed quality analysis for the CIDOC-CRM knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.  
Overall Summary  
CIDOC-CRM is a widely used conceptual model for cultural heritage integration, but as a dataset it lacks basic programmatic access points and machine-readable licensing. There is no SPARQL endpoint, no downloadable dump links, and the metadata reports 0 triples. Many quality dimensions cannot be assessed, leading to very low scores across Accessibility sub-dimensions (except a partial Availability), Representational, Intrinsic, and Contextual dimensions. FAIR indicators are mixed: identifiers and registration (F) are positive, but Interoperability (I) is low and Reusability (R) is hindered by the absence of an explicit license and standardized data access. Overall normalized quality score: 9.6 out of 100\.

- Believability (Score: 0.75/1)  
  - Description: The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is a theoretical and practical tool for information integration in the field of cultural heritage. It can help researchers, administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.
