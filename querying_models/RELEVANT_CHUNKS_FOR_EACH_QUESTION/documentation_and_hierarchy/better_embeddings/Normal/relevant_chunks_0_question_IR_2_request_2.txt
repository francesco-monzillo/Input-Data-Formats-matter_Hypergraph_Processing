In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  \r\n\r\n* the Italian Parliament. from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848. the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;\r\n* elections (laws. procedures. results). with reference to general elections as from 1848.  \r\n\r\nThe BPR addresses primarily studies in law. plus studies in political science. organisational science. political sociology. as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes. which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop.
