In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes. which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop.
