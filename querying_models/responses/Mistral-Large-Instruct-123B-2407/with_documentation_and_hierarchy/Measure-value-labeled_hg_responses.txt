Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
 No, a score of 0 for the amount of data dimension indicates that there is no data available for this specific metric within the dataset. It doesn't necessarily imply that the entire dataset is empty, but rather suggests that this particular aspect of the data has not been measured or is not applicable.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: if the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
