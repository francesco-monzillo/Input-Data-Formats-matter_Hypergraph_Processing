Question: IR_4.
Request: How accurate is WordNet?
Expected Response: 0.00
Response:
# WordNet Accuracy Assessment

Based on the RDF data provided, here's what we can determine about WordNet's accuracy:

## Explicit Accuracy Measurements

The dataset contains **Accuracy score measurements** for the W3C WordNet across multiple dates:

- **2025-05-04**: 0.0
- **2025-06-01**: 0.0
- **2025-07-13**: 0.0
- **2025-08-03**: 0.0
- **2025-09-07**: 0.0

**All measurements indicate an accuracy score of 0.0**, which is notably low.

## Context and Caveats

1. **Metric Definition Unclear**: The RDF data doesn't specify exactly what the "Accuracy score" metric measures. It could refer to:
   - Syntactic correctness of the RDF/OWL representation
   - Semantic accuracy of the WordNet data itself
   - Completeness or consistency metrics
   - Validation against a specific standard

2. **Other Quality Indicators**: The dataset shows mixed results on other metrics:
   - **Believability score**: 0.75 (good)
   - **FAIR score**: 3.11-3.3 (moderate)
   - **Consistency score**: 0.0 (poor)
   - **Completeness score**: 0.0 (poor)

3. **Reputation Score**: 5.02e-05 (very low)

## Conclusion

While the explicit "Accuracy score" is 0.0, this appears to be part of a quality assessment where multiple dimensions are measured separately. The relatively strong Believability score (0.75) and Findable/Accessible metrics suggest the RDF representation itself has value, but there are significant gaps in consistency and completeness.

Expected Response: 0.5
Response:
# Trustworthiness of the Linked Open Camera Dataset (BPR)

Based on the quality measurements provided in the RDF data, here's an assessment of the **BPR (Camera degli Deputati) dataset's trustworthiness**:

## Trust Metrics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Trust Value** | 0.5 | ⚠️ **Moderate** |
| **Accuracy Score** | 1.0 | ✅ **Excellent** |
| **Reputation Score** | ~7.5e-06 | ⚠️ **Very Low** |
| **Security Score** | 0.5 | ⚠️ **Moderate** |

## Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
1. **High Accuracy**: Perfect accuracy score (1.0) indicates data correctness
2. **Public Institution**: Published by the Italian Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati)
3. **Open Access**: Multiple download URLs available for RDF dumps
4. **Comprehensive Data**: 160+ RDF dump files covering parliamentary data
5. **Stable Data**: Measurements consistent across multiple monitoring dates (May-Sept 2025)

### ⚠️ Weaknesses
1. **Low Trust Score (0.5)**: Below the standard 0.75 of other datasets (LemmaBank, w3c-wordnet, etc.)
2. **Minimal Reputation**: Reputation score near zero suggests limited community recognition or citations
3. **Moderate Security**: Security score of 0.5 indicates potential vulnerabilities
4. **No DOI**: Data is not citable via persistent identifiers (F3-M score absent)
5. **Undefined Author/Contributor Info**: Missing clear attribution in metadata

## Recommendation

**The BPR dataset appears trustworthy for official parliamentary data but with caveats:**

- ✅ **Use for**: Historical legislative records, official parliamentary proceedings
- ⚠️ **Exercise caution for**: Critical research requiring extensive validation
- ❌ **Not suitable for**: Applications requiring high community validation or formal citability

The **moderate trust value (0.5)** reflects its role as government data (inherently authoritative) balanced against limited external validation and community engagement.

Question: TA_1.
Request: Is the number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint always the same?
Expected Response: No, they slightly increase over time.
Response:
# Analysis of NoiPA Triple Counts via SPARQL Endpoint

**No, the number of triples is not always the same.** Looking at the measurements for "Number of triples (query)" in the NoiPA dataset:

| Date | Triple Count |
|------|--------------|
| 2025-05-04 | 412,894,535 |
| 2025-06-01 | 419,389,676 |
| 2025-07-13 | 432,861,574 |
| 2025-08-03 | 439,796,613 |
| 2025-09-07 | 446,170,057 |

## Key Observations:

1. **Consistent Growth**: The triple count shows a steady increase across all measurement dates, growing from ~413M to ~446M triples
2. **Total Increase**: There's an increase of approximately **33.3 million triples** (over 8% growth) from May to September 2025
3. **Regular Updates**: The dataset appears to be continuously updated with new data at roughly monthly intervals

## Comparison with Metadata Triples:

Interestingly, the "Number of triples (metadata)" remains **constant at 340,000,000** across all dates, suggesting that metadata is more stable while the actual query data is actively growing.

This growth pattern is consistent with an operational, actively-maintained dataset like NoiPA that regularly ingests new data.

# Analysis of NoiPA Triple Count Over Time

Looking at the **"Number of triples (query)"** measurements for NoiPA, the values are **NOT constant**. Here's the data:

| Date | Number of Triples |
|------|-------------------|
| 2025-05-04 | 412,894,535 |
| 2025-06-01 | 419,389,676 |

| 2025-08-03 | 439,796,613 |
| 2025-09-07 | 446,170,057 |

## Key Observations:

1. **Steady Growth**: The triple count shows a consistent upward trend across all measurement dates
2. **Growth Rate**: The dataset increased by approximately **33.3 million triples** over the ~4 month period (from May to September 2025)
3. **Total Increase**: Overall growth of ~8% from the first to the last measurement

This indicates that the NoiPA dataset is actively being updated and expanded over time, rather than remaining static.

Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP always available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
# SPARQL Endpoint Availability for DBLP

Based on the data provided, **yes, the SPARQL endpoint for DBLP KG appears to be consistently available** across all measured dates.

## Evidence from the Data

The measurements show that the SPARQL endpoint status for dblp-kg is **"Available"** on all five measurement dates:

- 2025-05-04: Available
- 2025-06-01: Available
- 2025-07-13: Available
- 2025-08-03: Available
- 2025-09-07: Available

## Important Caveats

1. **Limited sample period**: These measurements only cover approximately 4 months (May to September 2025), so this doesn't necessarily indicate long-term reliability.

2. **Measurement frequency**: With only 5 data points spread across 4 months, there could be availability issues between measurement dates that aren't captured.

3. **Historical data not provided**: The dataset doesn't include historical measurements from before May 2025, so we cannot assess overall reliability over a longer period.

4. **Definition of "Available"**: The metric only checks if the server responds to a SPARQL query at the time of measurement, not continuous 24/7 uptime.

**Conclusion**: Within the measured period shown in this dataset, the DBLP SPARQL endpoint has been consistently available, but a more comprehensive availability assessment would require longer-term monitoring data.

Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the DBLP SPARQL endpoint always up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
# DBLP SPARQL Endpoint Availability

Based on the data provided, **yes, the DBLP SPARQL endpoint appears to be consistently available**.

The measurements show that across all five recorded dates:

- **2025-05-04**: Available ✓
- **2025-06-01**: Available ✓
- **2025-07-13**: Available ✓
- **2025-08-03**: Available ✓
- **2025-09-07**: Available ✓

All measurements for the "Sparql endpoint" metric on the DBLP Knowledge Graph dataset returned the value **"Available"** with a consistent status throughout the monitoring period.

## Important Note

However, there's an interesting discrepancy in the data: while the SPARQL endpoint itself is marked as "Available," the "Availability of RDF dump (query)" metric consistently shows **"False"** across all dates, meaning the RDF dump cannot be downloaded through the query interface, even though the endpoint is operational.

So to clarify: **The SPARQL endpoint is reliably up, but the downloadable RDF dump is not available**, which affects the overall data accessibility score.

Request: Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always set to 1 in the observed period?
Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
# Data Dump Availability for Allie Dataset

Looking at the measurement data for the metric **"Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"**, the values are **NOT** consistently set to 1 throughout the observed period.

Here's the breakdown:

| Date | Value |
|------|-------|
| 2025-05-04 | 1 |
| 2025-06-01 | 1 |
| 2025-07-13 | 1 |
| 2025-08-03 | 1 |
| 2025-09-07 | 0 |

**Key Finding:** The RDF metadata dump availability dropped to **0 on 2025-09-07**, indicating that the RDF dump became unavailable on that date after being consistently available (value = 1) throughout the previous four measurement periods.

This represents a degradation in data accessibility, as the metadata that was previously available for download is no longer accessible as of the September 7, 2025 measurement.

# Allie Dataset Dump Availability

Based on the data provided, **the RDF dump availability has changed over time**:

## Timeline:

| Date | Dump Available (Metadata) | Dump Available (Query) |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| 2025-05-04 | ✅ Yes (1) | ❌ No (False) |
| 2025-06-01 | ✅ Yes (1) | ❌ No (False) |
| 2025-07-13 | ✅ Yes (1) | ❌ No (False) |
| 2025-08-03 | ✅ Yes (1) | ❌ No (False) |
| 2025-09-07 | ❌ No (0) | ❌ No (-) |

## Summary:

- **Metadata dump**: Was available from May to August 2025, but **became unavailable by September 2025**
- **Query dump**: Was **never available** during the measurement period
- The most recent measurement (2025-09-07) shows the dump is marked as "No dump available"

Therefore, **the data dump is not reliably "always up"** — it appears to have become unavailable as of the latest measurement date. Users should check the [official Allie website](http://allie.dbcls.jp/) for current download options.

| 2025-05-04 | 0.9997 |
| 2025-06-01 | 0.9997 |
| 2025-07-13 | 0.99966 |
| 2025-08-03 | 0.99966 |
| 2025-09-07 | 0.99966 |

## Analysis:

1. **Initial Period (May-June)**: Accuracy was **0.9997**
2. **Later Period (July-September)**: Accuracy decreased slightly to **0.99966**

The change represents a minor decrease of approximately **0.00004** (or 0.004%), indicating a very slight degradation in accuracy between June and July 2025.

## Conclusion:

While the accuracy remains **very high** throughout the monitoring period (>99.96%), it is **not perfectly constant**. The dataset shows a minor but measurable decline in accuracy from the initial measurements to the later ones, though this may be within acceptable quality thresholds for most applications.

| 2025-08-03 | 0.99966 |
| 2025-09-07 | 0.99966 |

## Key Observations

1. **Very High Consistency**: The accuracy remains exceptionally high (>0.999) across all measurement dates, indicating stable data quality.

2. **Minor Fluctuation**: There is a small decrease from **0.9997** (May & June) to **0.99966** (July onwards), representing a decrease of approximately **0.00004 percentage points** - practically negligible.

3. **Stabilization**: After the slight dip in July, the accuracy stabilizes at 0.99966 for the remaining months (August and September).

## Conclusion

**Yes, NoiPA's accuracy is essentially consistent over time**, remaining at >0.999 throughout the measured period. The observed variation is minimal and could be attributed to normal data quality fluctuations rather than a systematic reliability issue. The dataset maintains excellent accuracy standards across all five measurement cycles.
