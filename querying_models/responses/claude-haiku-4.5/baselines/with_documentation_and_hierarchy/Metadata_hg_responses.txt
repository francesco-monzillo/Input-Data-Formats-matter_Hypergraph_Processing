Question: IR_4.
Request: Which is the accuracy score of WordNet?
Expected Response: 0.00
Response:
# WordNet 2.0 (W3C) - Accuracy Score

Based on the quality assessment reports provided, the **Accuracy score for WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is 0.0/1** across all analysis dates (2025-05-04 through 2025-09-07).

## Reason for Zero Score

The accuracy score is **0.0 because the SPARQL endpoint is missing or offline**. Accuracy metrics require a working SPARQL endpoint to assess:

- Triples with empty annotation problem
- Triples with white space in annotation (at beginning or end)
- Triples with malformed data type literals problem
- Functional properties with inconsistent values
- Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties

## Quote from Reports

From the 2025-09-07 report:
> **Accuracy (Score: 0/1)**
> - Triples with empty annotation problem: \-
> - Triples with white space in annotation(at the beginning or at the end): \-
> - Triples with malformed data type literals problem: \-
> - Functional properties with inconsistent values: \-
> - Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties: \-

The "-" symbol indicates these metrics **"could not be checked as the SPARQL endpoint is missing"**.

This is a consistent limitation across all WordNet assessment reports, as the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint prevents measurement of all intrinsic quality dimensions including Accuracy, Consistency, and Conciseness.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: IR_4.
Request: How accurate is WordNet?
Expected Response: 0.00
Response:
# Accuracy Assessment of WordNet 2.0 (W3C)

Based on the quality analysis reports, **WordNet 2.0 (W3C) itself cannot be directly evaluated for accuracy** due to a critical limitation: **the SPARQL endpoint is missing or offline**, which prevents any query-based accuracy checks.

## What the Reports Show

### Accuracy Score: **0.0/1** (Across All Reports)

All reports from 2025-05-04 through 2025-09-07 consistently show:

- **Triples with empty annotation problem:** \- (Could not be checked)
- **Triples with white space in annotation:** \- (Could not be checked)
- **Triples with malformed data type literals:** \- (Could not be checked)
- **Functional properties with inconsistent values:** \- (Could not be checked)
- **Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties:** \- (Could not be checked)

## Why This Matters

The accuracy score of **0.0** is **not** because WordNet data is inaccurate, but rather because:

1. **No working SPARQL endpoint** = cannot run data quality queries
2. **No accessible RDF dump** = cannot analyze the actual triples
3. **Intrinsic checks impossible** = structural and logical consistency cannot be verified programmatically

## What We Know About WordNet's Actual Quality

- **Source credibility**: WordNet is converted from Princeton's well-established linguistic database
- **Editors**: Mark van Assem, Aldo Gangemi, Guus Schreiber (reputable scholars)
- **Believability score**: 0.75/1 (indicates reasonable trustworthiness despite technical access issues)
- **License**: Apache 2.0 (clear, well-managed provenance)

## Conclusion

**WordNet's accuracy as a lexical database is likely high** (being based on Princeton WordNet), but **this quality dataset's operational accuracy cannot be formally verified** through the assessment methodology due to missing access infrastructure. To properly assess accuracy, you would need:

- A working SPARQL endpoint
- Or an accessible RDF dump to analyze locally
- Or explicit documentation of data validation procedures

Question: IR_5.
Request: How trustworthy is the Linked Open Camera dataset?
Expected Response: 0.5
Response:
# Trustworthiness Assessment of Linked Open Camera Dataset

Based on the quality reports provided, I cannot find a dedicated "Linked Open Camera" dataset in the documents. However, I can provide guidance on how to evaluate trustworthiness using the framework demonstrated in the reports.

## Key Trustworthiness Indicators from the Reports

The documents evaluate trust across three main dimensions:

### 1. **Believability (Score out of 1.0)**
- Clear, detailed description of the dataset's purpose
- Identified dataset URL
- Whether it's from a trusted provider list
- Base trust value assignment

**Example from reports:**
- **Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality**: Believability = 1.0 (trusted public authority)
- **dblp**: Believability = 0.75 (academic, well-known but not on official trusted list)
- **CIDOC-CRM**: Believability = 0.75 (reputable but not on trusted list)

### 2. **Reputation (Score out of 1.0)**
Measured via PageRank scores:
- High PageRank = higher reputation in the linked data ecosystem
- Low PageRank = less known/cited

**Examples:**
- Environment Agency: PageRank = 0.00028 (low but trusted institution)
- dblp: PageRank = not available (nan)
- Most academic datasets: very low PageRank (0.00005-0.0005 range)

### 3. **Verifiability (Score out of 1.0)**
Evaluates whether you can verify claims about the data:
- Author information (name, email)
- Contributor details
- Publisher information
- Source documentation
- Digital signatures

**Score ranges in reports:**
- With full provenance: 0.33-0.50
- With minimal info: 0.11
- Missing information: lower scores

---

## How to Assess Linked Open Camera Trustworthiness

If you're evaluating this dataset, check for:

### ✅ **Strong Trust Signals**
1. **Clear Metadata**: VoID/DCAT descriptions with author, publisher, source
2. **Institutional Backing**: From a recognized organization (museum, university, library)
3. **Licensing**: Machine-readable, clear open license (CC-BY, CC0, OGL)
4. **Documentation**: Examples, schemas, documentation of design choices
5. **Stability**: Historical modification dates, active maintenance
6. **Security**: HTTPS endpoint with clear access policies
7. **Interlinking**: Links to other well-known datasets (DBpedia, VIAF, etc.)

### ❌ **Red Flags for Low Trustworthiness**
- No identifiable author/publisher
- Missing or unclear licensing
- No SPARQL endpoint or dump access
- Zero or minimal interlinking
- No modification dates
- Unnamed or non-institutional sources
- Ontology hijacking issues detected
- Very low label coverage (suggests less curation)

---

## Typical Trust Score Profile for Academic/Cultural Datasets

Based on the reports' patterns, expect:

| Dimension | Typical Score | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| **Believability** | 0.5-0.75 | Academic/cultural institutions are moderately trusted without external certification |
| **Reputation** | 0.00001-0.0005 | Most specialized datasets have low web reputation |
| **Verifiability** | 0.11-0.50 | Often missing full author/contributor metadata |
| **Overall Trust** | Low-Moderate | Compensated by strong FAIR scores and clear documentation |

---

## Recommendation

**To assess Linked Open Camera specifically:**

1. Check if it has a working SPARQL endpoint
2. Look for institutional affiliation (university, museum?)
3. Verify author/publisher contact information
4. Review the license (must be machine-readable)
5. Examine interlinking quality (links to authority files like Getty, VIAF, etc.)
6. Check metadata completeness (VoID/DCAT records)
7. Verify HTTPS availability and any security features

The framework in these reports shows that **even low-reputation datasets can be trustworthy** if they have clear provenance, good documentation, stable access, and institutional backing.

Question: TA_1.
Request: Is the number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint always the same?
Expected Response: No, they slightly increase over time.
Response:
# NoiPA Triple Count Variance Across Reports

Based on the quality assessment reports provided, **No, the number of triples retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint for NoiPA is NOT always the same** across different assessment dates.

## Triple Count by Assessment Date

| Assessment Date | Triples (via Query/SPARQL) | Triples (via Metadata) |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-05-04 | 412,894,535 | 340,000,000 |
| 2025-06-01 | 419,389,676 | 340,000,000 |
| 2025-07-13 | 432,861,574 | 340,000,000 |
| 2025-08-03 | 439,796,613 | 340,000,000 |
| 2025-09-07 | 446,170,057 | 340,000,000 |

## Key Observations

1. **Consistent Growth Pattern**: The triple count via SPARQL queries shows a steady increase over time:
   - May 2025: ~412.9M triples
   - September 2025: ~446.2M triples
   - **Total increase: ~33.3 million triples (~8% growth)**

2. **Metadata Remains Static**: The metadata consistently reports 340 million triples throughout all assessment periods, indicating the metadata is not being updated to reflect the actual data growth.

3. **Discrepancy**: There is a persistent and growing gap between the declared metadata (340M) and the actual query results (~412M to ~446M).

## Why This Variation?

The reports explicitly note: *"The dblp KG is synchronized daily with the current and curated data of the dblp bibliography"* — suggesting NoiPA is actively maintained and updated between assessments, which explains the SPARQL endpoint returning increasing triple counts across assessment dates.

Response:
# Analysis of NoiPA Triple Count Consistency

Based on the quality assessment reports provided, **the triple count for NoiPA retrieved via SPARQL is NOT constant**. Here's the evidence:

## Triple Count Variations Across Reports

| Report Date | Triples via Query | Triples via Metadata | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-05-04 | 412,894,535 | 340,000,000 | ~72.9M |
| 2025-06-01 | 419,389,676 | 340,000,000 | ~79.4M |
| 2025-07-13 | 432,861,574 | 340,000,000 | ~92.9M |
| 2025-08-03 | 439,796,613 | 340,000,000 | ~99.8M |
| 2025-09-07 | 446,170,057 | 340,000,000 | ~106.2M |

## Key Observations

1. **Steady Growth**: The SPARQL-derived triple count shows a consistent upward trend over the ~4-month period:
   - May 2025: ~413M triples
   - September 2025: ~446M triples
   - **Total increase: ~33.3 million triples (+8.1%)**

2. **Metadata Stability**: The metadata-reported triple count remains fixed at **340 million**, suggesting the metadata may not be kept in sync with the live endpoint.

3. **Reported Update Frequency**: The dataset indicates an **ANNUAL** update frequency, yet the live data shows growth every month—suggesting either:
   - The update frequency metadata is outdated
   - Updates occur more frequently than documented
   - Data is continuously ingested/modified

## Conclusion

NoiPA's triple count **increases regularly** (approximately every month), indicating the knowledge graph is **actively maintained and growing**, even though metadata suggests annual updates.

Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP always available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
# SPARQL Endpoint Availability for DBLP

Based on the quality assessment reports provided, **the DBLP SPARQL endpoint is generally available**, but there are some nuances:

## Availability Status Across Reports

| Report Date | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-09-07 | Available | Endpoint responds to SPARQL queries |
| 2025-08-03 | Available | SPARQL endpoint is online |
| 2025-07-13 | Available | Endpoint responds to queries |
| 2025-06-01 | Available | The SPARQL endpoint responds |
| 2025-05-04 | Available | SPARQL endpoint is operational |

## Performance Characteristics

The endpoint consistently shows:
- **Median latency**: 0.13–0.556 seconds (well under the 1000ms guideline)
- **Median throughput**: 2.0–8.0 requests/second
- **Overall Performance Score**: 1.0/1 (perfect)

## Important Caveats

1. **HTTP vs HTTPS**: The endpoint does **not use HTTPS** according to the assessments (Security score: 0.5/1)
   - Endpoint URL: `https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql`

2. **RDF Dump Availability**: While RDF dumps are marked as available in metadata, they could **not be verified as online** via SPARQL queries in most assessment runs

3. **Consistency**: The endpoint has been available across all assessment periods (May–September 2025)

## Recommendation

The DBLP SPARQL endpoint appears reliable for querying, but users should be aware that:
- Access is unencrypted (HTTP, not HTTPS)
- Offline RDF dumps may not be currently accessible despite metadata claims
- Performance is generally good but not instantaneous

Vote:

## Availability Status
- **Status**: Available (confirmed across all assessment reports)
- **Endpoint URL**: `https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql`
- **Performance**: Consistently good
  - Median latency: 103-185 ms
  - Median throughput: 6.0-8.0 requests/second

## Key Findings Across Reports

| Date | Status | Latency | Throughput |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-05-04 | Available | ~185 ms | 6.0 req/s |
| 2025-06-01 | Available | 172 ms | 6.0 req/s |
| 2025-07-13 | Available | 0.169 s | 6.0 req/s |
| 2025-08-03 | Available | 0.130 s | 8.0 req/s |
| 2025-09-07 | Available | 0.159 ms | 6.5 req/s |

## Important Caveats

While the endpoint is **reliably available**, there are some limitations to note:

1. **RDF Dump Availability**: The RDF dump is indicated as available in metadata but **could NOT be confirmed as online** via SPARQL endpoint checks
2. **No HTTPS**: The endpoint does not use HTTPS (though metadata access does)
3. **Metadata vs. Query Discrepancies**: Some checks via metadata claim availability that endpoint queries could not confirm

## Conclusion

The DBLP SPARQL endpoint appears to be **reliably online and performant** based on the assessment records. However, for production use, you should:
- Verify current status directly before relying on it
- Be aware that while the endpoint is up, the advertised RDF dumps may not be directly accessible via SPARQL queries
- Check if HTTPS support has been added since these evaluations

Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
# Analysis of Allie RDF Dump Availability Across Reports

Looking at the **Availability of RDF dump (metadata)** metric across all Allie reports in the provided documents:

## Results by Report Date:

| Date | RDF Dump (metadata) | RDF Dump (query) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **2025-06-01** | 1 | False | Dump claimed online in metadata, but not confirmed via SPARQL |
| **2025-05-04** | 1 | False | Same discrepancy pattern |
| **2025-07-13** | 1 | False | RDF dump declared but offline when checked via SPARQL |
| **2025-08-03** | 1 | False | RDF dump indicated as online in metadata |
| **2025-09-07** | **0** | — | **RDF dump missing in metadata** |

## Answer:

**No, the data dump availability is NOT always set to 1.** 

- **Most reports (2025-06-01 through 2025-08-03)** show the RDF dump as marked available in **metadata (= 1)**, but automated checks consistently report it as **offline via query (= False)**.

- **The 2025-09-07 report** is notably different, showing the RDF dump as **missing in metadata (= -1)**, indicating either:
  - The metadata changed between assessments, or
  - A different metadata source/interpretation was used

This pattern suggests a **persistent gap between declared availability and actual accessibility** for the Allie dataset's RDF dump across most of the observed period.

# Allie RDF Dump Availability Analysis

Based on the quality assessment reports, **the Allie RDF dump shows inconsistent availability**:

## Key Findings Across Reports:

### Metadata Claims vs. Reality
- **Metadata indication**: Consistently reports RDF dump as "available online" (score: 1)
- **Actual availability (via SPARQL query checks)**: **Repeatedly reported as False/offline** across multiple assessment dates

### Report Timeline:

| Date | Metadata Status | Query-Based Check | Notes |
|------|---------------|----|-------|
| 2025-06-01 | Dump online (1) | **False** | "Not discoverable via SPARQL" |
| 2025-07-13 | Dump online (1) | **False** | "The RDF dump is offline when checked via SPARQL" |
| 2025-08-03 | Dump online (1) | **False** | "Not confirmed online via endpoint query" |
| 2025-09-07 | **Missing in metadata (-1)** | Not available | "RDF dump missing or not available according to metadata" |

## Conclusion

**The dump is NOT reliably available**. There's a persistent discrepancy between:
1. What metadata claims (dump available)
2. What automated SPARQL-based checks can confirm (dump appears offline)
3. Whether download links are actually discoverable

### Recommended Actions:
- Verify the actual RDF dump location and accessibility status
- Update VoID metadata to reflect true availability
- Publish stable, working download URLs if dumps exist
- Consider providing a SPARQL endpoint as the primary access method instead

- **No degradation**: There is no evidence of data quality erosion over time
- **Reliable data curation**: The consistency suggests robust data validation and maintenance practices
- **Contrasts with other weaknesses**: While accuracy is excellent, this stands in *marked contrast* to NoiPA's persistent struggles with:
  - Interlinking (degree 0, centrality 0)
  - URI dereferenceability (0.0)
  - Understandability (only 8.06–8.09% of triples labeled)
  - Consistency issues (ontology hijacking flagged)

## Conclusion

**NoiPA's accuracy is exceptionally consistent and reliable over time**, maintaining near-perfect scores across all evaluations. This indicates strong intrinsic data quality management, despite other quality challenges in accessibility and representational aspects.
