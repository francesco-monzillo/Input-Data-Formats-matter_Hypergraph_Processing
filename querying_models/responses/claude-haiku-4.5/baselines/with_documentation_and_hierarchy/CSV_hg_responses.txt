Question: IR_4.
Request: Which is the accuracy score of WordNet?
Expected Response: 0.00
Response:
# Accuracy Score of WordNet

According to the data provided, the **Accuracy score for WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is 0.0**.

This indicates that the dataset received no points in the accuracy dimension. The accuracy dimension typically measures data quality metrics such as:

- Triples with empty annotation problems
- Triples with white space in annotations
- Triples with malformed data type literals
- Functional properties with inconsistent values
- Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties

The zero score suggests that either:
1. The dataset could not be evaluated for these accuracy metrics (possibly due to SPARQL endpoint issues), or
2. The available data did not allow for these specific accuracy checks to be performed

This is reflected in the dataset's overall **normalized quality score of 3.3 out of 100** (or 0.033 on a 0-1 scale).

Request: How accurate is WordNet?
Expected Response: 0.00
Response:
# WordNet Accuracy Assessment

Based on the data provided, **WordNet 2.0 (W3C)** shows the following quality metrics:

## Key Accuracy Indicators

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy Score** | 0.0 |
| **Consistency Score** | 0.0 |
| **Overall Quality Score** | 0.121 |
| **FAIR Score** | 3.3 |

## Critical Issues

WordNet 2.0 demonstrates several significant limitations:

1. **No SPARQL Endpoint** - Missing working query interface
2. **No RDF Dump Available** - Data not accessible for download
3. **Zero Availability Score** - Cannot be accessed or verified
4. **Limited Metadata** - Minimal documentation and language support

## Strengths

- ✓ Clear licensing (Apache 2.0)
- ✓ Published by W3C (reputable source)
- ✓ Well-documented description
- ✓ Proper URI structure

## Overall Assessment

While WordNet itself is a **well-established and highly regarded** lexical database in NLP circles, this particular **W3C RDF version rates poorly on data quality metrics** due to:
- Lack of accessible endpoints
- No downloadable data
- Limited technical infrastructure for verification

**Recommendation**: For practical use, access WordNet through its [original Princeton distribution](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) rather than relying on this outdated W3C RDF conversion (last modified 12+ years ago).

Question: TA_1.
Request: Is the number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint always the same?
Expected Response: No, they slightly increase over time.
Response:
# Analysis of NoiPA Triple Count via SPARQL Endpoint

Looking at the data provided, **NO, the number of triples retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint is NOT always the same**.

## Key Observations:

### Consistent Value
The "Number of triples (query)" field shows **`-1` for all records**, which according to the metadata definition means:
> "integer: the number of triples; **-: The SPARQL endpoint is missing.**"

### However, "Number of triples (metadata)" Varies
The metadata-based triple counts show variation across different analysis dates:

| Analysis Date | Number of Triples (metadata) |
|---|---|
| 2025-08-03 | 340,000,000 |
| 2025-05-04 | 340,000,000 |
| 2025-06-01 | 340,000,000 |
| 2025-07-13 | 340,000,000 |
| 2025-09-07 | 340,000,000 |

While the metadata-based counts remain constant at **340,000,000 triples**, the fact that the SPARQL endpoint query returns `-1` across all records suggests:

1. **The SPARQL endpoint may not be functioning properly** for triple count queries, or
2. **The measurement methodology cannot successfully retrieve this metric via SPARQL**

This is a significant data quality issue, as it prevents verification of actual triple counts through direct endpoint queries.

Question: TA_1.
Request: The number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint is constant?
Expected Response: No, they slightly increase over time.
Response:
# Analysis of NoiPA Triple Counts

Looking at the data provided, I can see **four records for NoiPA** with their analysis dates and corresponding triple counts:

| Analysis Date | Number of Triples (query) |
|---|---|
| 2025-08-03 | 439,796,613 |
| 2025-05-04 | 412,894,535 |
| 2025-06-01 | 419,389,676 |
| 2025-07-13 | 432,861,574 |

## Answer: **No, the triple count is NOT constant**

The number of triples retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint **varies significantly**:

- **Range**: ~412.9M to ~439.8M triples
- **Difference**: ~26.9 million triples between minimum and maximum
- **Variation pattern**: The counts show fluctuation rather than a steady state:
  - May (412.9M) → June (419.4M) → July (432.9M) → August (439.8M)
  - This represents an overall **increasing trend** of about 6.8M triples per month

## Possible Explanations:

1. **Data growth**: NoiPA is actively adding new data to the knowledge graph
2. **Data updates**: Regular updates and modifications to existing triples
3. **Query variations**: Different query execution times or cached results
4. **Index optimization**: Changes in how the RDF data is indexed or stored

This variation is actually **healthy** for an active, maintained open data project, indicating that the data is being regularly updated and curated.

Request: Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always set to 1 in the observed period?
Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
# Analysis of Allie Dataset RDF Dump Availability

Looking at the "Availability of RDF dump (query)" column across all five records for the Allie dataset, the values are:

1. **2025-05-04**: False
2. **2025-09-07**: - (missing/unavailable)
3. **2025-06-01**: False
4. **2025-07-13**: False
5. **2025-08-03**: False

## Answer

**No**, the data dump is **not** always set to 1 (True). In fact, it is consistently set to **False** or missing across all observed dates in the dataset. This indicates that the RDF dump for the Allie dataset's query endpoint was either:

- Offline during the assessment periods, or
- Not available for download

This is notably different from the "Availability of RDF dump (metadata)" column, which shows values of 1 (True) across the records, suggesting that metadata dumps may have been available while query dumps were not.

Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
# Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Dataset - Dump Status

Based on the data provided, **the RDF dump availability for the Allie dataset is inconsistent across monitoring periods**:

## Key Findings:

| Date | Availability Status |
|------|-------------------|
| 2025-05-04 | **Available (True)** |
| 2025-09-07 | **Not Available (False)** |
| 2025-08-03 | **Available (True)** |
| 2025-07-13 | **Available (True)** |
| 2025-06-01 | **Available (True)** |

## Analysis:

- **Overall Availability**: 4 out of 5 recent checks show the dump as available
- **Most Recent Check (2025-09-07)**: Shows **False** - indicating the dump was **offline or unavailable** at that time
- **Pattern**: The dataset appears to be generally available, but had at least one outage in the most recent monitoring period

## Recommendation:

While the Allie dataset generally maintains an available RDF dump, **you should not assume it is always up**. The September 7, 2025 check indicates potential reliability issues. If you depend on this dump:
- Monitor its availability regularly
- Have fallback options to query via the SPARQL endpoint (`http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql`)
- Consider implementing retry logic with appropriate timeouts
