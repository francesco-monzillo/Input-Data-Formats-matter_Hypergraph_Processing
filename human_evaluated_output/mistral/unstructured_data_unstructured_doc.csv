* **Interlinking**: Most datasets have very low interlinking scores, indicating minimal connections to external datasets.
* **Consistency**: Some datasets have consistency issues, such as ontology hijacking, which affects their overall quality.
* **Understandability**: Many datasets have low understandability scores, indicating that a significant portion of their triples lack labels or comments.
* **Performance**: Some datasets have performance issues due to missing or non-operational SPARQL endpoints.
* **Security**: Some datasets have security issues due to missing HTTPS support or authentication mechanisms.
* **Dynamicity**: Some datasets lack clear modification timestamps, which affects their timeliness scores.

How can these issues be addressed to improve the overall quality scores?
To improve the overall quality scores, the following actions can be taken:

* **Availability**: Ensure that RDF dumps are available and accessible via stable download links. Provide working SPARQL endpoints for querying the data.

Co_5,What are the dimensions performing better in September 2025?,"License, Performance, Accuracy, Believability, Currency, Timeliness, Security, Conciseness and Interpretability","The dimensions performing better in September 2025 vary across different knowledge graphs, but some common trends can be observed:

1. **Accessibility**:
   - **Availability**: Most knowledge graphs have a working SPARQL endpoint, but some have issues with RDF dump availability or metadata indicating availability but not providing download links.
   - **Licensing**: Most knowledge graphs provide machine-readable licenses, but human-readable licenses are often missing.
   - **Interlinking**: Generally low, with some knowledge graphs showing interlinking but minimal completeness.
   - **Security**: Mixed results with some knowledge graphs supporting HTTPS but not requiring authentication, while others do not support HTTPS.
   - **Performance**: Varies widely, with some knowledge graphs showing acceptable performance while others struggle with latency and throughput.

2. **Representational**:
   - **Versatility**: Many knowledge graphs lack declared serialization formats and media types, affecting interoperability.
   - **Representational conciseness**: Generally good, but some knowledge graphs have issues with URI lengths and RDF structure usage.
   - **Understandability**: Low across the board, with few knowledge graphs providing adequate label/comment coverage and vocabulary information.

3. **Intrinsic**:
   - **Consistency**: Mixed results with some knowledge graphs showing strong consistency while others face issues like ontology hijacking and undefined terms.
   - **Accuracy**: Generally high, with most knowledge graphs scoring perfectly on accuracy metrics.

4. **Contextual**:
   - **Amount of data**: Varies widely, with some knowledge graphs having a large number of triples while others are more modest.
   - **Completeness**: Generally low, reflecting minimal interlinking and metadata completeness.

5. **Trust**:
   - **Believability**: High for most knowledge graphs, reflecting strong metadata and clear descriptions.
   - **Reputation**: Low for most knowledge graphs, reflecting limited PageRank and author/contributor information.
   - **Verifiability**: Mixed results, with some knowledge graphs providing author information while others lack it.

6. **Dynamicity**:
   - **Currency**: Mixed results, with some knowledge graphs providing recent modification dates while others lack this information.
   - **Timeliness**: Generally low, reflecting a lack of update frequency information.

7. **FAIR**:
   - **Findability**: Generally strong, with most knowledge graphs providing rich metadata and machine-readable licenses.
   - **Accessibility**: Mixed results, with some knowledge graphs providing working SPARQL endpoints and RDF dumps while others struggle in these areas.
   - **Interoperability**: Generally strong, reflecting the use of standard vocabularies and metadata formats.
   - **Reusability**: Generally strong, reflecting the provision of machine-readable licenses and clear metadata.

These trends highlight the need for improvements in areas like Accessibility (especially RDF dump availability and metadata accuracy), Representational (serialization formats and media types), Understandability (label/comment coverage and vocabulary information), Consistency (addressing ontology hijacking and undefined terms), and Dynamicity (providing update frequency information). Additionally, maintaining strong FAIR principles across all dimensions is crucial for enhancing the overall quality and usability of these knowledge graphs.
