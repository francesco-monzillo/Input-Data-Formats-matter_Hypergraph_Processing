1. **Accuracy Score**: The accuracy score for WordNet is consistently reported as 0.000000 across multiple entries. This indicates that there might be issues with the accuracy of the data in WordNet.

2. **Representational-Consistency Score**: The Representational-Consistency score is also reported as 0.000000, suggesting potential issues with the consistency of the representations within WordNet.

3. **Interpretability Score**: The interpretability score is reported as 0.000000, indicating that there might be challenges in interpreting the data accurately.

4. **Completeness Score**: The completeness score is also reported as 0.000000, which suggests that the dataset might not be complete or comprehensive.

5. **Performance Score**: The performance score is reported as 0.000000, indicating potential performance issues with the dataset.
