E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided data, the ""Availability score"" is a composite measure calculated from several individual availability metrics. The DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) has a perfect score of 1.0 because it scores highly on the key metrics that contribute to this overall score. Here are the specific reasons: SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset consistently has an ""Available"" SPARQL endpoint. {""14071"":[""Sparql endpoint"",""dblp-kg"",""Available"",""2025-07-13""]} {""24121"":[""dblp-kg"",""Available"",""Sparql endpoint"",""2025-08-03""]} RDF Dump Availability: The metadata RDF dump is available for download, scoring a perfect 1.0. {""14072"":[""1.000000"",""2025-07-13"",""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"",""dblp-kg""]} {""3122"":[""Availability for download (metadata)"",""1.000000"",""2025-05-04"",""dblp-kg""]} URI Dereferenceability: The dataset's URIs are dereferenceable, meaning they can be looked up over the web, which also receives a perfect score of 1.0. {""14073"":[""1.000000"",""2025-07-13"",""dblp-kg"",""URIs Deferenceability""]} {""24123"":[""dblp-kg"",""URIs Deferenceability"",""2025-08-03"",""1.000000""]} The combination of having an accessible SPARQL endpoint, a downloadable RDF dump, and dereferenceable URIs results in a perfect ""Availability score"" of 1.0 for the DBLP dataset.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided data, the dblp-kg dataset has a high availability score, which is 1.0 on some dates (e.g., 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03), because it meets several key criteria for availability: SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has a consistently ""Available"" SPARQL endpoint at the URL https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql. Metadata Download: The ""Availability for download (metadata)"" and ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" consistently have a perfect score of 1.000000. Downloadable Dumps: It provides direct URLs for downloading the dataset, specifically https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz. FAIR Metrics: It scores perfectly (1.0) on FAIR-related availability metrics such as ""A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources"" and ""A1-D Working access point(s)"". These factors combined result in a very high, and on some dates, perfect availability score.",1,1,0.5,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the provided information, a score of 0 for ""Amount of data"" indicates that the metrics used to measure the dataset's size found a negligible or zero amount of data. The ""Amount of data score"" is defined as an ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"". The individual metrics that contribute to this score include: Number of triples (query) Number of entities Number of property If a dataset were empty, the values for these metrics would be zero, which would result in an overall ""Amount of data score"" of 0.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the provided information, no, an ""Amount of data score"" of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. Here's the explanation: The score is a calculated value: The ""Amount of data score"" is defined as an ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores."" A zero score indicates measurement failure: A score of 0 would mean that the individual metrics used in the calculation (like ""Number of triples (query)"" or ""Number of entities"") have the worst possible values. This can happen if the information cannot be retrieved (e.g., a SPARQL endpoint is missing or a VoID file is absent), not just if the values are actually zero. Example from the data: The dblp-kg dataset has a low ""Amount of data score"" of 0.333333 and its ""Number of triples (metadata)"" is recorded as 0. However, the same dataset has a ""Number of labels/comments present on the data"" of over 157 million (157046912.000000), which clearly indicates that the dataset contains a substantial amount of data. Therefore, a score of 0 for ""Amount of data"" signifies that the metrics used to calculate the score could not be successfully measured or were at their lowest possible values, rather than confirming the dataset is empty.",1,1,0.5,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working. Here is the evidence from the dataset dblp-kg: On 2025-08-03, the dataset dblp-kg has an Availability score of 1.000000. {""24269"":[""Availability score"",""1.000000"",""2025-08-03"",""dblp-kg""]} On that same date, its Sparql endpoint was ""Available"". {""24121"":[""dblp-kg"",""Available"",""2025-08-03"",""Sparql endpoint""]} However, the Availability of RDF dump (query) was ""False"", meaning the dump was offline. {""24222"":[""Availability of RDF dump (query)"",""dblp-kg"",""2025-08-03"",""False""]} This example shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score of 1 even when only the SPARQL endpoint is online and the RDF dump is not.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"Based on the provided text, an ""Availability score"" of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up. The definition for ""Availability score"" is: ""Overall score for the availability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores"". This does not specify that all components must be online for a perfect score. An example from the data confirms this. For the dataset dblp-kg on 2025-07-13: The Availability score is 1.000000. The Sparql endpoint is ""Available"". The Availability of RDF dump (query) is ""False"". This shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score of 1.0 even when the RDF dump is offline, as long as the SPARQL endpoint is available.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Based on the provided data, no, a value of ""1"" does not necessarily mean that an open license is used. The measure R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source is defined as follows: Description: ""Any license retrievable"" Output: ""1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"" This means a value of ""1"" simply indicates that license information was found and is explicitly reported for the dataset. It does not evaluate the type of license (i.e., whether it is open or restrictive).",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Based on the provided data, no, a value of ""1"" for the license measure does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.

It measures the presence of a license, not whether the license itself is open.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"Based on the provided data, yes, a Verifiability score of 1 implies that all information about the providers is set. Here's the breakdown from the file: Verifiability score is defined as the ""Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores,"" with 1 being the best value. The individual metrics that have ""Verifiability"" as their dimension are the ones that check for provider information, such as: Sources: Stating the author, contributors, publisher, and sources. Author (metadata): Stating the author. Author (query): Stating the author. Publisher: Stating the publisher. Contributor: Stating the contributors. Signed: Checking if the dataset is signed. Since the overall score is a combination of these individual metrics, achieving the best possible score of 1 would require that all the component metrics also have their best possible scores, meaning the provider information they check for is present.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"Based on the provided file, a Verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all information about providers is set, but it does indicate a very high level of verifiability.
Here's the breakdown from the file:
Definition of Verifiability Score: The Verifiability score is defined as the ""Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores.""
Individual Verifiability Metrics: The file lists several metrics that belong to the ""Verifiability"" dimension, which are the components of this score. These include:
Sources
Author (metadata)
Author (query)
Publisher
Contributor
Signed
Because the final score is a ""linear combination,"" a score of 1 implies that most or all of these individual metrics scored perfectly. It is a strong indicator that information about the author, publisher, contributors, and sources is well-documented.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
