E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided data, the ""Availability score"" is a composite measure calculated from several individual availability metrics.

E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) has an availability score of 1.0 (as seen on dates like 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) because it is highly accessible through multiple methods: Available RDF Dump: The dataset is available for download as an RDF dump, which is confirmed by a score of 1.0 for the ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" metric.

Contributing Metrics: The individual metrics that belong to the ""Amount of data"" dimension include: Number of triples (query) Number of entities Number of property A score of 0 for the combined ""Amount of data score"" implies that the values for these underlying metrics were likely zero or that the information could not be retrieved (e.g., the SPARQL endpoint was missing or a VoID file was absent).

Its best value is 1. Provider Information Metrics: The metrics related to provider information that fall under the ""Verifiability"" dimension include: Author (metadata) Author (query) Publisher Contributor Sources Since the overall score is a combination of these individual scores, the only way to achieve a perfect score of 1 is if all the component metrics also have perfect scores.
