TA_5,What is the longest continuous period in which the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset data dump has been equals to 1?,"Based on the provided quality reports, the data dump for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset was never available (equal to 1). The reports from 2025-09-07, 2025-08-03, and 2025-05-04 all explicitly state that no RDF dump was available or that download links were not found.",91 days,0,0,0,0

E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,"Based on the report from 2025-07-13, the DBLP dataset achieved an availability score of 1.0 because its SPARQL endpoint was available, an RDF dump was indicated as online and available for download in the metadata, and its URIs were 100% dereferenceable.",Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,1,1,"0.5",1
E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,"According to the provided quality report, the Availability score for the dblp Knowledge Graph is 0.73915/1, not 1.0/1. The score is less than 1.0 because the RDF dump and its download availability are not indicated in the metadata, resulting in values of -1 for ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" and ""Availability for download (metadata)"".",Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,0,0,0,0
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, based on the provided report, a score of 0.333 for ""Amount of data"" can mean the dataset is empty. For instance, several entries show ""Number of triples (metadata): 0"" while the overall score for the ""Amount of data"" dimension is 0.333. A score of 0 is not present for this dimension in the report.","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.",0,1,0,0
E&D_2,"if the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, not necessarily. According to the documentation and the report structure, the ""Amount of data"" score is based on whether the number of triples, entities, or properties can be retrieved. A score of 0 would indicate that none of these metrics could be determined, either because the information is not provided in the metadata or because it could not be retrieved from the SPARQL endpoint. This means the size of the dataset is unknown, not that it is definitively empty.","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.",1,1,1,1
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?","No. Based on the provided report, a knowledge graph with an availability score of 1.0 had an available SPARQL endpoint, but the RDF dump could not be verified via SPARQL queries (`Availability of RDF dump (query): False`).",Yes,0,0,0,0
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?","No, based on the provided report, there is a case with an Availability Score of 1.0/1 where the SPARQL endpoint is ""Available"", but the ""Availability of RDF dump (query)"" is ""False"", meaning the dump could not be verified via SPARQL queries.",Yes,0,0,0,0
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, according to the documentation for the 'R1.1 – License availability' metric, a score of 1 (True) only validates whether a usage license is available, not whether the license is open.","No, it means that a license is specified",0.5,0.5,"0.5",0.5
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, based on the documentation for metric R1.1 – License availability, a score of 1 only indicates that a usage license is available, not that the license is an open one.","No, it means that a license is specified",0.5,0.5,"0.5","0.5"
E&D_5,"If believability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set? ","No, based on the documentation, a Believability score of 1 means that the dataset uses recognized vocabularies (e.g., FOAF, DC, SKOS), not that all information about providers is set.",Yes,0,0,0,0
E&D_5,"If the believability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?","No. According to the documentation, the 'Believability' category only includes the 'Trusted vocabulary usage' metric, which checks for the use of recognized vocabularies. Information about the provider, such as creator or publisher, is assessed by the 'Provenance metadata' metric.",Yes,0,0,0,0
