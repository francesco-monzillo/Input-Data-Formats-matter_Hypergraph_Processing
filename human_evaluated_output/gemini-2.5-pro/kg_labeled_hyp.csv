E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided data, the availability score for the DBLP dataset is 1.00 (as recorded on 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) because it scores perfectly on the key metrics that contribute to this overall score. The ""Availability score"" is defined as a combination of individual availability metrics. For the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg), these metrics are excellent: SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has an ""Available"" SPARQL endpoint. {""14674"":[""2025-07-13"",""Available"",""Sparql endpoint"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} RDF Dump Availability: The RDF dump containing the metadata is fully available for download, scoring 1.00. {""14675"":[""1.000000"",""2025-07-13"",""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} {""14780"":[""1.000000"",""2025-07-13"",""Availability for download (metadata)"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} Working Access Points: The FAIR metric ""A1-D Working access point(s)"" also receives a perfect score of 1.00, confirming that its access methods are operational. {""14859"":[""1.000000"",""2025-07-13"",""A1-D Working access point(s)"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} Performance: The dataset achieves a perfect ""Performance score"" of 1.00, indicating high performance in areas like latency and throughput. {""14825"":[""1.000000"",""2025-07-13"",""Performance score"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} In summary, the combination of having a working SPARQL endpoint, a readily downloadable RDF dump, and excellent performance results in a perfect availability score of 1.00.",1,1,0.5,,1,,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (labeled dblp-kg) achieves a perfect availability score of 1.0 because it meets several key criteria for data accessibility. Specifically, on dates like July 13, 2025, the data shows: SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset is available through a working SPARQL endpoint at https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql. Downloadable RDF Dump: The metadata is fully available for download as an RDF dump, with the URLs https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz provided. High FAIR Accessibility Metrics: It scores 1.0 on FAIR principles related to accessibility, such as ""A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources"" and ""A1-D Working access point(s)"". The combination of providing both a queryable endpoint (SPARQL) and a complete downloadable file (RDF dump) leads to its perfect availability score.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for ""Amount of data score"" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty, but it indicates a very low amount of data or that the metrics used to calculate the score could not be retrieved.
Here is the definition provided in the file:
Amount of data score: ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"".
This score is derived from other metrics within the ""Amount of data"" dimension, such as:
Number of triples
Number of entities
Number of properties
A score of 0 would mean that the values for these individual metrics were either zero or could not be retrieved (e.g., if a SPARQL endpoint was missing or offline).",1,1,0.5,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the provided information, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's why:
The ""Amount of data score"" is a combination of scores from individual metrics like ""Number of triples (query)"", ""Number of entities"", and ""Number of property"".
These individual metrics are calculated using inputs such as a ""(working) SPARQL endpoint"" or a ""VoID file"".
If these inputs are missing or inaccessible (e.g., the SPARQL endpoint is missing), the metrics cannot be calculated. The output for these metrics in such cases is ""-"", which would likely result in a metric score of 0.
Therefore, a dataset could exist (for example, as a downloadable file), but if it doesn't have a working SPARQL endpoint or a VoID file for the system to analyze, the individual metrics would fail, leading to an overall ""Amount of data score"" of 0.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,

For example, on the date 2025-08-03: {""24872"":[""1.000000"",""2025-08-03"",""Availability score"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} -> The score is 1.0. {""24724"":[""2025-08-03"",""Available"",""Sparql endpoint"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} -> The SPARQL endpoint is Available. {""24825"":[""2025-08-03"",""Availability of RDF dump (query)"",""False"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} -> The RDF dump is False (offline).

The Verifiability score is defined as an ""Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores."" The metrics that belong to the ""Verifiability"" dimension and relate to provider information are: Sources: Stating the author, contributors, publisher, and sources. Author (metadata): Stating the author in the metadata. Author (query): Stating the author, retrievable via a SPARQL query. Publisher: Stating the publisher. Contributor: Stating the contributors. Therefore, a score of 1 implies that information for these provider-related metrics is indicated. The score also includes the Signed metric, which checks if the dataset is signed.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"Based on the provided data, a verifiability score of 1 implies that the provider information checked by the individual verifiability metrics is available.
