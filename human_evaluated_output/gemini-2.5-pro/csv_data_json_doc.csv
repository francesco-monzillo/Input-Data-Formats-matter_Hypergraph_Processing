E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided report and documentation, the availability score for the DBLP dataset is 1 because the dataset is highly accessible through multiple methods. Specifically: *   The SPARQL endpoint is ""Available"". *   The ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" metric is 1, indicating that a downloadable RDF dump is provided and online. *   The FAIR metric ""A1-D Working access point(s)"" has a score of 1, which signifies that there is an ""operational SPARQL or accessible data dump"".","0.5",0,"0.5",,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the report, the DBLP dataset's availability score is 1 (or very close to 1) because it scores highly on the key metrics that constitute availability: 1.  **SPARQL endpoint:** The endpoint is consistently reported as ""Available"". 2.  **Availability of RDF dump (metadata):** The metric has a score of 1, indicating that an RDF dump is provided and online. 3.  **Performance:** The ""Median latency"" is very low (e.g., 0.172 ms), which is well below the 1000 ms threshold, and it has a positive ""Median throughput"" (e.g., 6.0). 4.  **URIs Deferenceability:** The score is nearly perfect (e.g., 0.9993), indicating that the URIs within the dataset are successfully dereferenceable.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for ""Amount of data"" does not mean the dataset is empty. According to the documentation, this score is an ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"". For example, in the provided report, the `w3c-wordnet` knowledge graph has an ""Amount of data score"" of 0.0, but its ""Number of triples (metadata)"" is 710,000, which clearly indicates the dataset is not empty.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, based on the provided documentation and data, an ""Amount of data score"" of 0 does not mean the dataset contains no data. The ""Amount of data score"" is described as an ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"". For example, the `w3c-wordnet` knowledge graph has an ""Amount of data score"" of 0, but the ""Number of triples (metadata)"" metric for the same graph is 710,000, indicating the presence of data.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"No, based on the documentation and the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working. The FAIR metric `A1-D Working access point(s)` states that a score of 1 is given for an ""operational SPARQL **or** accessible data dump"". For example, the NoiPA knowledge graph has an availability score of 1.0, its SPARQL endpoint is ""Available"", but the report indicates ""No dump available"".",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"No, based on the documentation and the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.  The documentation states that the `Availability score` is a ""linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores"". One of these related metrics, `A1-D Working access point(s)`, gives a score of ""1: operational SPARQL or accessible data dump"". The use of ""or"" implies that having only one of these access methods available is sufficient to achieve a high score for that specific metric, which in turn contributes to the overall availability score.  For example, in the provided report, the `micro-coronavirus` dataset has an `Availability score` of 1.0, but the metric `Availability of a common accepted Media Type` has a value of ""No dump available"", indicating the data dump is not accessible.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","No, based on the provided documentation, a value of 1 for the metric ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" only means that a license is explicitly reported, not necessarily that it is an open license.",0.5,0,"0.5",,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","No, based on the documentation for the metric ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"", a value of 1 means that a license is explicitly reported, but it does not specify whether the license is open or not.",0.5,0,"0.5",,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_5,"If believability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set? ",Yes,"No, the documentation does not explicitly state which metrics contribute to the Believability score. It defines the Believability score as an ""Overall score for the believability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual believability metrics scores"". Without knowing which specific metrics are included in this linear combination and their respective weights, it is not possible to conclude that a score of 1 means all information about providers is set.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the believability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, according to the documentation, the ""Believability score"" is an ""Overall score for the believability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual believability metrics scores"". A score of 1 indicates that all the individual metrics contributing to this dimension have achieved their maximum value. These metrics verify the presence of information such as authors, publishers, and sources, but it does not guarantee that all possible provider information is available, only that the specific checks performed for the score calculation have passed with the highest possible result.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
