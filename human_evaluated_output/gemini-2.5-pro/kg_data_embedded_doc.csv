E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The provided Knowledge Graph does not contain the documentation or definition for the 'Availability score' metric, so it is not possible to determine why the value is 1.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,The provided data does not contain information explaining why the availability score is 1.,0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.",The provided Knowledge Graph and its documentation do not contain information about what a score of 0 for the 'Amount of data score' metric signifies.,0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, based on the provided documentation, the 'Amount of data score' is an 'Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores'. A score of 0 represents the lowest possible value in its [0,1] range, but it does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data, as it is a computed value derived from other individual metrics.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"No. According to the 'A1-D Working access point(s)' metric, a score of 1 means 'operational SPARQL or accessible data dump'.","0.5",0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"No. According to the 'A1-D Working access point(s)' metric, a score of 1 means ""operational SPARQL or accessible data dump"". Additionally, for the 'Availability of RDF dump (metadata)' metric, a score of 1 only means ""The RDF dump is online"" and does not account for the SPARQL endpoint.","0.5",0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","No, according to the metric documentation, a value of 1 means ""license explicitly reported"", which does not specify if the license is open.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","No. According to the metric documentation (`http://example.org/vocab/MetricOutput`), a value of 1 means ""license explicitly reported"", not that the license is open.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If believability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set? ",Yes,"The provided Knowledge Graph does not define the Believability score metric. It only states that 1 is the best value, but does not specify what this means in relation to provider information.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the believability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"Based on the provided documentation, it is not possible to determine. The Believability score is defined as an ""Overall score for the believability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual believability metrics scores"", but the specific individual metrics, such as provider information, are not mentioned.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
