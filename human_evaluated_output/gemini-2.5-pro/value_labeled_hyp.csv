E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided data, the availability score for the DBLP dataset is 1.0 because it scores perfectly on the key individual metrics that contribute to this overall score.
The ""Availability score"" is defined as a composite score computed from individual availability metrics. For the DBLP dataset, these metrics show high availability:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has a consistently available SPARQL endpoint.
{""Available"":[""Sparql endpoint"",""2025-05-04"",""dblp-kg""]}
{""Available"":[""2025-07-13"",""dblp-kg"",""Sparql endpoint""]}

{""1.000000"":[""2025-08-03"",""A1-D Working access point(s)"",""dblp-kg""]}

E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) achieved a perfect availability score of 1.0 on 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03. This score is based on several contributing factors that indicate high accessibility:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has an ""Available"" SPARQL endpoint.
Metadata Download: The metadata is available for download, with Availability for download (metadata) and Availability of RDF dump (metadata) both scoring 1.0.
Working Access Points: The dataset has working primary sources for both its data and metadata, as shown by the A1-D Working access point(s) and A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources metrics, which are both 1.0.",1,1,0.5,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the provided information, a score of 0 for ""Amount of data score"" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty, but it does represent the worst possible score for that dimension.
Here's the breakdown from the text:
Definition: The ""Amount of data score"" is described as an ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"".
Input: Its input is the scores from other metrics, such as ""Number of triples (query)"" and ""Number of entities"".
Output: The score is a value between [0,1], where 1 is the best value.
Therefore, a score of 0 indicates that the underlying metrics (like the number of triples, entities, etc.) either returned a value of zero or could not be computed, resulting in the lowest possible score for this combined dimension.",1,1,0.5,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the provided information, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's why:
The ""Amount of data score"" is a combination of scores from individual metrics like ""Number of triples (query)"", ""Number of entities"", and ""Number of property"".
These individual metrics are calculated using inputs such as a ""(working) SPARQL endpoint"" or a ""VoID file"".
If these inputs are missing or inaccessible (e.g., the SPARQL endpoint is missing), the metrics cannot be calculated. The output for these metrics in such cases is ""-"", which would likely result in a metric score of 0.
Therefore, a dataset could exist (for example, as a downloadable file), but if it doesn't have a working SPARQL endpoint or a VoID file for the system to analyze, the individual metrics would fail, leading to an overall ""Amount of data score"" of 0.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,

E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.

For example, on the date 2025-08-03: {""24872"":[""1.000000"",""2025-08-03"",""Availability score"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} -> The score is 1.0. {""24724"":[""2025-08-03"",""Available"",""Sparql endpoint"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} -> The SPARQL endpoint is Available. {""24825"":[""2025-08-03"",""Availability of RDF dump (query)"",""False"",{""label"":""dblp-kg""}]} -> The RDF dump is False (offline).
