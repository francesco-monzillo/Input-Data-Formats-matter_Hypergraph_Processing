IR_4,Which is the accuracy score of WordNet?,0.00,"The accuracy score for WordNet (identified as w3c-wordnet in the dataset) is consistently reported as 0.000000 across all available measurement dates (2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03, 2025-09-07).

Summary:
Dataset	Accuracy Score	Measurement Dates
w3c-wordnet	0.000000	All dates between 2025-05-04 and 2025-09-07
Key Observations:
Consistency: The score is uniformly 0.000000 across all recorded timestamps, indicating no variation in accuracy.
Scale: The accuracy score follows a normalized scale of [0,1], where 1.000000 represents maximum accuracy. A value of 0.000000 signifies the lowest possible score.
Supporting Metrics: Other quality dimensions (e.g., F-score, Completeness, Interpretability) vary for WordNet, but Accuracy remains unchanged.

Accuracy metric context:

The accuracy dimension likely evaluates semantic correctness (e.g., correctness of synonymy/hyponymy relationships). A score of 0 suggests:
Potential inconsistencies in lexical-semantic relations.
Outdated classifications (as WordNet evolves slowly).
Mismatches with real-world usage (e.g., domain-specific terms).
Companion scores:

Believability: 0.800 (high confidence in source reliability).
Verifiability: 0.332 (limited metadata for verification).
FAIR score: ~3.1–3.3 (moderate compliance).
Interlinking: 0.000 (no links to external datasets).
Methodological note:
Accuracy scores of 0.000 may indicate strict evaluation criteria (e.g., alignment with a gold-standard ontology not fully met by WordNet).

Key Observations
Conflicting signals: High believability but low accuracy suggests:
Trust in WordNet's authority ≠ alignment with evaluator's benchmarks.
Possible gaps in dynamic/domain-specific coverage.
Recommendation:
Treat WordNet as a high-level reference ontology, but verify terms against domain-specific resources (e.g., UMLS for biomedicine).

Below is a structured analysis:

🔑 Key Trustworthiness Metrics
Metric	Value (Avg.)	Concerns/Actions
Trust Value	0.500	Low on security (1.000 is worst)
Accuracy	0.600-1.000	Good
Verifiability	0.110	Very poor (critically weak)
Believability	0.500	Minimal confidence
Consistency	~0.308-0.499	Low consistency in metadata/responses
Security	0.000-1.000	Critical vulnerability: Requires authentication, HTTPS is used (True), but lax endpoint security
License Compliance	✅	Uses CC BY-SA 3.0 (human/machine-readable)
Provider Trust List	❌	Not listed as a trusted provider
⚠️ Critical Concerns
Authentication: Supports HTTPS but lacks robust verification (Requires authentication = False inconsistently scored).
Vulnerabilities: No HTTPS for metadata endpoints, risking MITM attacks (Use HTTPS: NoiPA=False, bpr=True mixed).
Data Privacy: SPARQL endpoint lacks encryption during query transmission (http://dati.camera.it/sparql).
Source Traceability: Poorly documented author/publisher metadata (_authors_specified=0.0).
Metadata Gaps: Absence of VoID/DCAT descriptors (a FAIR principle violation).
Inconsistent Signatures: No digital signatures (Signed=False) reduce trust in integrity.
Interoperability: Uses RDF structures (True) but vocabularies are poorly reused (_reuse_of_existing_terms=0.000).
Findability: Low Reputation Score (0.000008) and absent from search engines (A2-M=0.000000).
Accessibility: Data dumps unavailable (Availability for download (query)=False).
🟢 Positive Attributes
Accuracy: Near-perfect 1.000 for factual correctness (e.g., ""bpr"" provider).
Licensing: Clear CC BY-SA 3.0 terms (License machine redeable).
Performance: SPARQL endpoint latency is minimal (Performance score=0.505-0.750).

E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The availability score of 1.000000 for the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) occurs in entries like {""Availability score"":[""dblp-kg"",""1.000000"",""2025-08-03""]}. Here's why this happens:

✅ Key Reasons for the Perfect Availability Score (1.0)
Metadata-Based Availability:

Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.000000
Indicates well-documented metadata about the RDF dump is always available.
Availability for download (metadata) = 1.000000
Metadata like licensing (Licensing score = 0.500000) and schema details are retrievable.
SPARQL Endpoint Accessibility:

Sparql endpoint = ""Available""
The dataset is queryable via SPARQL (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql), ensuring programmatic access.
Proper Media Type Compliance:

Availability of a common accepted Media Type = True
Uses standard RDF serializations like RDF/XML, NTriples, or Turtle.
URI Dereferenceability:

F1-D URIs dereferenceability = 1.000000
Unique URIs in the dataset resolve to valid data/resources (HTTP 200 OK).
Dataset URL Stability:

Dataset URL = https://dblp.org
A persistent, working primary access point.
⚠️ Caveats in Other Entries
The score fluctuates to 0.750000 or 0.975000 in other entries due to transient failures in metrics like:

Availability of RDF dump (query) = False (dump not downloadable).
Availability VoID file = ""VoID file absent"" (Optional metadata file; not strictly required).
However, the SPARQL endpoint availability and metadata compliance are sufficient to achieve a perfect 1.0 score when all critical components align.

🧮 How the Score is Calculated
The availability score aggregates sub-metrics such as:

Metadata accessibility (e.g., RDF dump metadata, licensing info).
Functional access points (e.g., SPARQL endpoint, dataset URL).
Technical compliance (e.g., media types, URI dereferencing).
When these components validate successfully, the score maximizes to 1.0.

🗂️ Summary
The DBLP dataset earns Availability = 1.0 when:

Metadata is complete.
SPARQL endpoint is online (primary access method).
URIs resolve correctly.
Standard formats are used.
This reflects compliance with FAIR principles (e.g., F1, A1) for data accessibility.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the provided dataset, the DBLP Knowledge Graph (dblp-kg) achieves an Availability Score of 1.000 (on specific dates like 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) due to fulfillment of the following FAIR criteria:

Key Factors Contributing to Availability Score = 1.000
🟢 A1-M: Metadata Availability via Working Primary Sources
1.000000 on all dates

Ensures metadata is retrievable via primary access points like SPARQL or web interfaces.
🟢 F1-D: URIs Dereferenceability
1.000000 on most dates (except 0.900000 on 2025-05-04)

URIs resolve correctly, guaranteeing data accessibility via HTTP(S).
🟢 Availability of RDF Dump (Metadata)
1.000000 on all dates

Metadata is available as an RDF dump (e.g., dblp.ttl.gz).
🟢 A1-D: Working Access Point(s)
1.000000

SPARQL endpoint (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql) and RDF dump (https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz) are operational.
🔴 Limitations Not Penalizing Availability

Although Availability of RDF dump (query) and Availability for download (query) are False, these do not override compliance with working access points (e.g., SPARQL endpoint).
⚠️ Licensing Limitations

Licensing score is 0.500000, but this affects Reusability (R-score), not Availability (A-score).
Formula Breakdown
The Availability Score (A

​
 ) likely follows a weighted aggregation:

Conclusion
DBLP achieves maximal availability due to functional endpoints, resolvable URIs, and metadata accessibility, despite minor limitations in query-based access. The score reflects compliance with FAIR-A principles.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0.000000 in the Amount of data score does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty. Here's why:

Key Findings
Score Definition
The ""Amount of data score"" is defined as:

""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of individual metrics (e.g., number of triples, entities, properties). Output: [0, 1], where 1 is best.""

A score of 0 indicates poor performance in this dimension, not absence of data.

Contradictory Evidence from Data
Metrics in your dataset explicitly show non-empty data for entries with ""Amount of data score"": 0.000000:

For dblp-kg (score 0 on 2025-08-03):

{""Number of triples (query)"":[""dblp-kg"",""1335106894.000000"",""2025-05-04""]}
For bpr (score 0 on 2025-07-13):

{""Number of labels/comments present on the data"":[""bpr"",""30576153.000000"",""2025-09-07""]}
Possible Reasons for Low Scores

Incomplete metrics (e.g., missing metadata, sparse interlinking).
Subpar performance in critical metrics (e.g., low entity/triple diversity).
Normalization artifacts (e.g., datasets may have data but fail to meet scoring thresholds).
Conclusion
A score of 0.000000 reflects structural/data quality issues—not emptiness. Datasets with low scores often still contain data, but they underperform in the evaluated criteria like completeness, interlinking, or metadata richness.

For empty datasets, look for ""Number of triples"": 0 or ""entities"": 0 instead.",0.5,1,0.5,,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, an ""Amount of data score"" of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains absolutely no data. Instead, it indicates that the dataset scored the lowest possible value on the metrics used to evaluate ""Amount of data"" under the predefined scoring system. This could reflect:

Extremely sparse data,
Missing critical data elements (e.g., no triples, few entities, or insufficient metadata),
Failure to meet minimal thresholds for data volume in the evaluation framework.

    ""output"": ""[0,1]. Best value: 1."",
    ""dimension"": ""Amount of data""
  }
}
Scores close to 0 reflect poor performance in data volume metrics (e.g., low triple counts, missing entities).
Examples in Your Data:

No dataset here has an ""Amount of data score"" of exactly 0, but several score 0.333 (e.g., CIDOC-CRM, LemmaBank), indicating low-but-nonzero data.
Scores near 0 would likely result from metrics like:
""Number of triples (query)"": ""None"" (e.g., for bbc-programmes)
""Number of entities"": ""None"" (e.g., for w3c-wordnet).
Contrast with ""Completeness score"":

Datasets like dblp-kg have a ""Completeness score"" of 0.000 but still have an ""Amount of data score"" of 0.333, proving:
Completeness ≠ Amount: A dataset can have data (non-zero amount) but fail completeness checks (e.g., missing metadata).
Summary Table
Score	Meaning	Example in Data
Amount of data = 0	Minimal/no data by evaluation metrics (e.g., no triples, entities). May have partial data.	Not observed in this dataset
Amount of data > 0	Some data exists, but score reflects volume against benchmarks (e.g., CIDOC-CRM = 0.333).	""CIDOC-CRM"": 0.333
Completeness = 0	Data exists, but critical metadata/dimensions are missing (e.g., labels, interlinking).	""dblp-kg"": 0.000

E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"The availability score aggregates metrics related to the accessibility of SPARQL endpoints and RDF data dumps. Based on the provided data and the definition of A1-D Working access point(s), here's the breakdown:

A1-D Working access point(s) Definition:

Output:
1 = Operational SPARQL endpoint or accessible RDF dump
0.5 = Partially accessible endpoint/dump
0 = Neither works
Implication: A score of 1 indicates at least one functional access point (either SPARQL or dump).
Availability score Calculation:

Combines multiple availability metrics (e.g., SPARQL uptime, RDF dump download capability, metadata availability).
A score of 1 means all availability-related metrics are optimal, including both SPARQL and RDF dump accessibility.
Key Conclusion:
If Availability score = 1, both the SPARQL endpoint and RDF data dump are functional and meet the highest accessibility standards.
If only one access point works, the score would be <1 (e.g., 0.5).
Example from Data:
dblp-kg has an Availability score of 0.975 (near-maximum), indicating both endpoints and dumps are working but minor imperfections exist.
No dataset in the provided data achieved a score of 1, reinforcing that it requires rigorous availability compliance.

""Sparql endpoint"": [""dblp-kg"",""Available"",...]
""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"":[""dblp-kg"",""1.000000"",...]
In contrast, datasets like ""bpr"" score 0.5 when only the SPARQL endpoint is Available (""False"" for the dump).

Answer
Yes, an availability score of 1 means both the SPARQL endpoint and RDF data dump are operational and accessible.

Explanation
The overall ""Availability score"" integrates metrics like ""Sparql endpoint"" and ""Availability of RDF dump"".
Perfect score (1) requires both to be online (""Available"" for SPARQL and 1 for the dump), as seen in ""dblp-kg"".
A score of 0.5 implies only one access point works (e.g., SPARQL endpoint up but dump missing/offline, as in ""bpr"").

Open Licenses
Are defined by standard licenses like:

Creative Commons (CC-BY, CC0, CC-BY-SA)
Apache 2.0
Open Government Licence (OGL)
Example URIs in the dataset:
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
Licenses with R1.1 = 1 (retrievable) are often (but not always) open:

Datasets with R1.1 = 1 (e.g., bpr, LemmaBank, w3c-wordnet) use open licenses like:
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa (CC-BY-SA)
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero (CC0)
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.it (CC-BY 3.0)
Open licenses dominate the datasets with R1.1 = 1, but non-open licenses could theoretically score 1 if retrievable.
Counterexamples:

CIDOC-CRM has R1.1 = 0 (license not retrievable) and no open license URI.
All datasets with Licensing score = 1 (e.g., micro-coronavirus) use open licenses (e.g., http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
Final Answer
Yes, when license = 1 (i.e., retrievable), the license is typically open in this dataset.
All licenses marked with R1.1 = 1 in the provided records are standard open licenses (e.g., CC-BY, Apache 2.0), but the value 1 itself strictly indicates retrievability, not openness.

Metric Definition:

Input: ""(Meta)data""
Output: 1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise
Dimension: FAIR
Purpose: Checks if license metadata is retrievable, not whether the license itself is ""open.""
Licensing Observations:

Dataset entries like bpr, dblp-kg, or LemmaBank have R1.1 = 1.000000, indicating their licenses are machine- or human-readable and retrievable.
However, the specific license type (e.g., Apache 2.0, CC-Zero, CC-BY-SA) determines openness. For example:
bpr uses http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, open).
dblp-kg uses https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ (CC0, open).
Scores:

A ""Licensing score"" of 0.5 (e.g., bpr, LemmaBank) suggests partial compliance with licensing best practices. This could mean:
Only metadata is retrievable, but not via query endpoints.
No human-readable license documentation exists (e.g., bpr has ""License human redeable"": [""-"", ""False""]).
Conclusion:
R1.1 = 1 confirms a license is explicitly reported, but openness depends on the license type (e.g., CC-BY, Apache 2.0).
To verify openness, check the actual license URL (e.g., ""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"" is open, while proprietary licenses are not listed here).

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"No, setting the Verifiability score to 1 does not necessarily mean all provider information is fully set. The score aggregates multiple metrics, some of which may be incomplete even if the overall score is maximal. Here’s why:

Key Observations:
Verifiability Score Calculation

The score is a linear combination of sub-metrics (e.g., provider trust, dataset signature, source attribution).
Example: For CIDOC-CRM, the score is 0.331667, but its Is on a trusted provider list is False.
Constraint: Individual Metrics ≠ Perfect

Even with a perfect Verifiability score (1.0), some provider-related metrics might still return False or missing data if they are not critical to the weighted calculation.
For instance, ""environment-agency-bathing-water-quality"" is marked trusted (""Is on a trusted provider list"": ""True""), yet its Verifiability score is only 0.165 – indicating other metrics lowered the aggregate.
Verifiability Metrics
The score depends on:

Is on a trusted provider list
Signed (dataset cryptographic signature)
Sources (author/publisher metadata)
Author (metadata)
Publisher
Contributor
Other trust/identity signals.
Edge Cases

A dataset with all verifiability metrics passing would score 1.0, but based on the data, no provider achieves this.
For example, bpr consistently scores 0.110000 despite partial compliance.
Verdict:
A Verifiability score of 1.0 would reflect optimal performance across evaluated metrics, but not necessarily every traceable detail about providers. Partial information gaps can still exist if they do not dominantly impact the scoring formula.

Recommendation:
Audit the weights of individual Verifiability sub-metrics if full provider transparency is required, as high-level scores may mask granular deficiencies.

Metric	Input	Output	Dimension
Is on a trusted provider list	Metadata	Boolean (True/False)	Believability

E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, a Verifiability Score of 1 does not inherently guarantee that all provider information is available. Instead, it indicates that the dataset achieves the highest possible score based on the specific verifiability metrics evaluated (e.g., completeness of metadata, trusted provider status, clarity of sources). Here's why:

Key Analysis:
Verifiability Score Definition:


{

}
It is a linear combination of individual verifiability metrics (e.g., Sources, Is on a trusted provider list, Author (metadata)).
Primary Metrics Under Verifiability:

Is on a trusted provider list: Boolean (True/False).
Sources: Checks if authors, contributors, publishers, and sources are documented.
Author (metadata) / Publisher: Metadata completeness checks.
None of these metrics require perfect scores in all sub-criteria to achieve a composite score of 1.
Evidence from Data:

Example: CIDOC-CRM has a verifiability score of 0.331667 but:
Is on a trusted provider list: False (all dates).
Sources: ""Web:https://cidoc-crm.org/ Name: Email:"" (incomplete email).
Even high verifiability scores (e.g., NoiPA with 0.498333) still show False for Is on a trusted provider list.
Mathematical Interpretation:

Let the verifiability score V be:
V= 
i=1
∑
n
​
 w 
i
​
 ⋅m 
i
​
 
where w 
i
​
  are weights and m 
i
​
  are normalized metric scores (0≤m 
i
​
 ≤1).
V=1 does not imply m 
i
​
 =1 for all i (some metrics may be weighted less or compensated by others).
When Does V=1 Imply Full Provider Information?
Metric	Required for V=1?	Example Constraints
Is on a trusted provider list	Yes	Must be True (weighted heavily in some frameworks).
Sources	Partial	Some implementations accept partial metadata (e.g., missing emails).
Author (metadata)	Partial	May tolerate absent fields if other metadata compensates.
Conclusion:
A Verifiability Score of 1 means the dataset meets the defined thresholds for its composite metrics, but not necessarily that every provider detail is exhaustively available. Always check the underlying metrics (e.g., Is on a trusted provider list = True, Sources = explicit) for full transparency.
