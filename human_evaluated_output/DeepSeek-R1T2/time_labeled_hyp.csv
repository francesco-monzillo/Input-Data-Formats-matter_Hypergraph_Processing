Key Observations from the Data:
Consistent Score: All reported entries for ""w3c-wordnet"" and ""Accuracy score"" across different dates (e.g., 2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-09-07) show a value of 0.000.

Dimension: ""Accuracy"".
Additional Context:
This score is part of a broader quality assessment framework applied to knowledge graphs. Other scores (e.g., Consistency, Conciseness, FAIR scores) are reported for WordNet, but the accuracy metric remains consistently zero.
Such scores are often computed using automated metrics, SPARQL queries, or metadata analysis. A low score may indicate issues like inaccurate/incomplete data, labeling errors, or validation failures.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,

Conclusion:
WordNet scores critically low in accuracy (0/1) in this assessment, likely due to structural/data-quality issues (e.g., interlinking or annotation problems). Its higher believability (0.8) and moderate verifiability suggest it retains value as a semantic resource, but its accuracy under these metrics is not validated.

TA_1,Is the number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint always the same?,"No, they slightly increase over time.","Based on the provided data, the number of triples retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint for NoiPA is NOT always the same. Here's the definitive analysis:

Key Findings
Variable Triple Counts Across Dates:

2025-05-04: 412,894,535 triples
2025-07-13: 432,861,574 triples
2025-08-03: 439,796,613 triples
2025-09-07: 446,170,057 triples
The triple count increases monotonically over time, confirming dynamic updates to the dataset.

Supporting Evidence:

Percentage of data updated metrics (e.g., 4.4825957471189065e-07% on 2025-09-07) indicate incremental changes.
Dataset modification dates (e.g., 2025-09-01) and metrics like Triples with white space in annotation... confirm ongoing updates.
Amount of data score fluctuates (e.g., 0.666667), reflecting variable data volume.
Static Metadata vs. Dynamic Query:

Number of triples (metadata) is fixed at 340,000,000, likely a cached/precomputed value.
SPARQL-queried triples (Number of triples (query)) directly reflect live dataset changes.
Conclusion
The SPARQL endpoint returns varying triple counts over time due to dataset updates. Use queried triple counts (not metadata) for real-time accuracy.

📊 Discrepancy Analysis
Metadata Claim ≠ Actual Data
The metadata states 340M triples, but SPARQL queries consistently return ~412M–446M, suggesting metadata is outdated or stale.

Possible Causes

Dataset Updates: Query counts increase over time (412M → 446M), indicating new triples were added.
Metric Definition:
Number of triples (metadata) is static (potentially declared VoID/dump size).
Number of triples (query) dynamically counts triples via SPARQL.

Below is the breakdown:

🔑 Key Reasons
Metadata Availability:

A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources = 1.000000: Metadata can be reliably retrieved via primary sources.
A2-M Registered in search engines = 1.000000: The dataset is indexed in search engines, enhancing discoverability.
Data Access:

Availability for download (metadata) = 1.000000: Metadata is downloadable.
Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.000000: RDF dumps are available (query-specific dumps may not be, but metadata dumps are).
SPARQL endpoint = ""Available"": The SPARQL endpoint is operational (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql).
URI Dereferenceability:

F1-D URIs dereferenceability = 1.000000: All URIs resolve correctly.
📉 Why the Score Varies Over Time
The availability score fluctuates based on individual metric performance on specific dates:

Date	Availability Score	Key Changes
2025-05-04	0.975000	Slight dip (~2.5%) due to partial dereferenceability (URIs Deferenceability = 0.900000).
2025-07-13	1.000000	All critical metrics meet 1.0, SPARQL endpoint available, metadata intact.
2025-08-03	1.000000	Same as above.
2025-09-07	0.750000	Significant drop due to failed RDF dump availability (Availability of RDF dump (query) = False).
📜 Formal Calculation
The availability score is a weighted linear combination of sub-metrics (e.g., Availability score=w 
1
​
 ⋅A1-M+w 
2
​
 ⋅A2-M+...). It reaches 1.0 only when all relevant sub-metrics are fully satisfied.

💡 Conclusion

📌 Summary
The score reflects real-time accessibility status, where perfect scores denote:

✅ Metadata and RDF dumps downloadable
✅ SPARQL endpoint responsive
✅ Licenses clearly retrievable
Consistency in these services directly correlates with the score's stability.",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for ""Amount of data"" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty.

Key Insights:
Metric Definition:
The ""Amount of data score"" is a computed metric combining multiple indicators (e.g., number of triples, entity counts, availability of metadata). A score of 0 indicates poor performance across these metrics, not necessarily emptiness.

Evidence from Data:
In your JSON output:

Datasets like CIDOC-CRM and LemmaBank have an ""Amount of data score"" of 0.333333 despite having data (e.g., ""Number of triples (query)"": ""1335106894.000000"" for dblp-kg).
When datasets are truly empty, the JSON typically logs None or 0.000000 for explicit fields like ""Number of triples"".
Contextual Interpretation:
A score of 0 could arise from:

Technical failures (e.g., SPARQL endpoint unreachable).
Missing metadata (e.g., no VoID file or labels).
Structural issues (e.g., invalid triples or low interlinking).
Formula Context:
The score aggregates metrics like:

Amount of Data Score=w 
1
​
 ⋅(Triples)+w 
2
​
 ⋅(Entities)+…
A score of 0 means all contributing metrics underperform, not that the dataset has zero triples.

Recommendation:
Check raw metrics (e.g., Number of triples (query), Number of entities) to confirm emptiness. A score of 0 should trigger investigation, not deletion.

Here's why:

Key Analysis
Score Definition:
The ""Amount of data score"" is a composite metric computed from multiple underlying data metrics (e.g., number of triples, entities, labels/comments). A score of 0.000000 indicates that the dataset fails to meet minimum thresholds for these metrics, not that it is entirely empty.

Evidence from Your Data:

Explicit Triples Presence:
For datasets like dblp-kg, even with an ""Amount of data score"" of 0.333333, the metric Number of triples (query) shows 1.3B triples (e.g., {""2025-05-04"":[""dblp-kg"",""Number of triples (query)"",""1335106894.000000""]}).
Labels/Comments Metric:
NoiPA has 35M+ labels/comments ({""2025-05-04"":[""NoiPA"",""Number of labels/comments present on the data"",""33307267.000000""]}) despite a low/zero score.
Possible Reasons for a 0.000000 Score:

Missing critical metadata (e.g., no working SPARQL endpoint).
Low scores in ≥1 constituent metrics (e.g., sparse labels, few entities).
Algorithmic thresholds not being met for the composite score.

The score is likely a weighted function of N metrics M

Conclusion
A score of 0 signifies poor performance in the ""amount of data"" dimension (e.g., incomplete, sparse, or poorly structured data), not an absence of data. Always check raw metrics (e.g., Number of triples) for concrete insights.",1,1,0.5,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"From the provided metrics and dataset examples, an availability score of 1 indicates both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF data dump are operational. Here’s the breakdown:

Key Metrics Defining the Availability Score
A1-D Working access point(s) (FAIR dimension)

Output:
1: Operational SPARQL endpoint or accessible data dump
0.5: Accessible SPARQL endpoint or data dump
0: Neither works
Logic: A score of 1 requires at least one fully functional access point (SPARQL/dump).
Individual Availability Checks

Availability of RDF dump (query):
True: Dump online, False: Offline, -: Missing
Sparql endpoint:
Available: Online, Offline: Broken, -: Missing
When is the Availability Score 1?
A score of 1 implies:

Both endpoints are functional:

The SPARQL endpoint is Available (and)
The RDF dump returns True (online).
Example:


""2025-07-13"": [""dblp-kg"", ""Availability score"", ""1.000000""]
This corresponds to:

Sparql endpoint: Available
Availability of RDF dump (metadata): 1.000000 (online)
For contrast, datasets like w3c-wordnet score 0.5 due to a missing SPARQL endpoint (Sparql endpoint: -) despite having an online dump.

Formula
The availability score (A) is derived as:

A= 
⎩
⎨
⎧
​
  
1
0.5
0
​
  
if SPARQL endpoint = Available ∧ RDF dump = True
if either SPARQL or dump is functional
otherwise
​
 
Summary
✅ Score = 1: Both SPARQL endpoint and RDF dump work.
⚠️ Score = 0.5: Only one access point works.
❌ Score = 0: No functional access points.

🔍 Key Findings:
Availability Score Definition:

The ""Availability score"" is computed as a linear combination of individual availability metrics (e.g., SPARQL endpoint status, RDF dump accessibility, inactive links).
A score of 1 represents the best possible value for availability.
Critical Metrics:

Sparql endpoint status (output: Available, Offline, or - if missing).
Availability of RDF dump (query/metadata checks with outputs like True, False, -).
A1-D Working access point(s):
1: Operational SPARQL or accessible data dump.
0.5: Only one is accessible.
0: Neither is available.
Observations:

Datasets like dblp-kg achieve an Availability Score of 1 when both conditions are met:
Sparql endpoint = Available (e.g., https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql).
Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1 (dump is online).
Conversely, datasets like bpr score 0.5 (SPARQL online but dump offline).
Mathematical Interpretation:

Let S represent SPARQL endpoint status (1 if available, 0 otherwise).
Let D represent RDF dump availability (1 if online, 0 otherwise).
The Availability Score A likely follows:
A=max(S,D)+other metrics
For A=1, both S=1 and D=1 are necessary (assuming no penalties from other factors).
✅ Conclusion:
Yes, an Availability Score of 1 indicates that both the SPARQL endpoint and RDF data dump are fully operational and accessible. This is supported by dataset examples like dblp-kg where high scores coincide with both services being online. A score below 1 implies partial (e.g., 0.5) or complete unavailability (0).

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","The JSON data provided contains extensive metadata about various datasets and their licensing information. To answer your question directly:

If a license metric (e.g., _machine_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable) is set to 1, it means a license was successfully retrieved, but this does not guarantee that an open license is used. Here's the breakdown:

Key Findings
1 Indicates License Presence, Not Openness:

Metrics like _machine_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable: 1.000000 confirm that license metadata was found (e.g., in VoID files or SPARQL endpoints), but not whether the license is open.
Example metric definition:

""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"": {
  ""output"": ""1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise""
}
Open Licenses Are Explicitly Named:

Open licenses appear in the data as URLs like:
https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ (CC0, public domain)
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (CC BY 4.0)
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 (Apache 2.0)
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero (Open Definition compliant)
Non-Open or Unclear Licenses:

Some entries have incomplete metadata (e.g., License machine redeable (query): ""-"").
Others use licenses like http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.it (locale-specific CC BY 3.0), which may have nuances.
Licensing Scores Correlate with Openness:

Datasets with Licensing score: 1.000000 (e.g., micro-coronavirus) use confirmed open licenses (e.g., CC BY 4.0).
Lower scores (e.g., 0.500000) indicate partial compliance (e.g., metadata exists, but openness is unverified).
Conclusion
1 ≠ Open License: A value of 1 means a license was detected, not that it is open.
Openness Requires Explicit License: Check the specific license URL (e.g., CC BY, Apache 2.0) to confirm openness.
Use Licensing Scores: Scores near 1.000000 strongly suggest open licenses.

What ""1"" signifies:
In your dataset, metrics like R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source define ""1"" as:

Output: 1: license explicitly reported (not ""open license"").
Description: A license is retrievable via metadata or primary sources, but not necessarily open.
This is a FAIRness metric (retrievability), not a direct indicator of license openness.

Open licenses in your dataset:
The licenses explicitly mentioned (e.g., Apache-2.0, CC-BY, CC-Zero, OGL) are all open licenses. Examples:

https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (CC-BY 4.0)
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero (CC-0)
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
Key observation:
While your dataset only contains open licenses, a value of 1 in R1.1 does not enforce openness—it merely confirms a license exists. In other datasets, a 1 could represent a restrictive license.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"Based on the provided data and the definitions of the metrics, setting the ""Verifiability score"" to 1 does not necessarily mean all provider information is fully set. Here's the breakdown:

Key Analysis
Verifiability Score Definition

The Verifiability score is an aggregate metric computed as a linear combination of multiple sub-metrics (e.g., provider trust, source documentation, licensing, etc.).
Best value: 1, but this requires all underlying verifiability metrics to be satisfied.
Provider Trust Metric

Is on a trusted provider list is a sub-metric of the ""Believability"" dimension, not directly part of ""Verifiability"".
It outputs a boolean (True/False) indicating whether the provider is trusted.
In the dataset, most providers (e.g., CIDOC-CRM, bpr, dblp-kg) are explicitly marked as False for this metric:

{""2025-05-04"":[""bpr"",""Is on a trusted provider list"",""False""]}
{""2025-05-04"":[""CIDOC-CRM"",""Is on a trusted provider list"",""False""]}
Verifiability Sub-Metrics

Verifiability depends on metrics like:
Sources: Whether data sources are documented.
Author (metadata), Publisher, Contributor: Whether authorship/publishing info is provided.
Signed: Whether the dataset is cryptographically signed.
Example: NoiPA has a high verifiability score (0.498333) despite not being a trusted provider (False):

{""2025-07-13"":[""NoiPA"",""Verifiability score"",""0.498333""]}
{""2025-07-13"":[""NoiPA"",""Is on a trusted provider list"",""False""]}
Perfect Score Requirements

A verifiability score of 1 would require all verifiability-related metrics to be optimal:
Sources documented (Sources = non-False),
Author/publisher info present (Author (metadata) ≠ False),
License retrievable (Licensing score = 1),
Signed dataset (Signed = True).
Conclusion
No: A verifiability score of 1 does not guarantee all provider information (e.g., trusted provider status) is set.
Trusted Provider Status: This is a separate metric (Is on a trusted provider list) under Believability, not Verifiability.
The highest verifiability score observed in the data is 0.498333 (NoiPA), suggesting no dataset achieves 1.0 in this metric.
Summary Table
Metric	Dimension	Dependence on Verifiability=1	Example Values
Is on a trusted provider list	Believability	Independent	False (most datasets)
Verifiability score	Verifiability	Requires all sub-metrics	0.110000–0.498333
Author (metadata)	Verifiability	Required	Often False
Signed	Verifiability	Required	Often False
Believability vs. Verifiability:
Trusted provider status (Believability) measures how credible the provider is, while verifiability checks whether metadata (e.g., sources, authorship) is documented enough to verify the data.

No Overlap:
A dataset can have fully documented sources (high verifiability) but come from an untrusted provider (low believability), and vice versa.",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,

Key Insights
Verifiability Score Definition:

The verifiability score is a linear combination of individual verifiability metrics (e.g., ""Sources,"" ""Author,"" ""Publisher,"" ""Contributor"").
A score of 1 represents the best possible value, indicating all verifiability metrics were satisfied.
Provider Trust vs. Verifiability:

Is on a trusted provider list is explicitly part of the believability dimension (dimension: Believability), not verifiability.
Example: CIDOC-CRM has a high believability score (0.8) but is not on a trusted provider list (""Is on a trusted provider list"": ""False"").
Provider Information Metrics:

Metrics like Sources, Author (query), Publisher, and Contributor directly impact verifiability:
Example: Sources outputs False if metadata is missing, lowering the verifiability score.
Example datasets (bpr, NoiPA, CIDOC-CRM) consistently show Author (query): ""[]"" or Publisher: ""-"", indicating unavailable data.
Empirical Observations:

No dataset achieves a verifiability score of 1 in the provided data (max observed: 0.498333 for NoiPA).
Even datasets with high verifiability scores (e.g., NoiPA: 0.498333) lack complete provider info, such as Trust value: 0.75 and Author: ""Name: absent"".
Conclusion
A verifiability score of 1 would imply all verifiability-related provider metadata is fully available, but no dataset achieves this in practice. Provider trust (Is on a trusted provider list) is a separate believability metric and does not directly influence verifiability.",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,
