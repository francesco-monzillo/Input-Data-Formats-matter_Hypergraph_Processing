IR_2,Which is the amount of data of the LiLa Lemma Bank dataset?,"1,699,687","The **LiLa Lemma Bank** dataset consistently contains **1,699,687 triples** across all reports. This value is explicitly confirmed in the `Amount of data` metric under the metadata-derived triple count (e.g., `Number of triples (metadata): 1699687`).

### Key Evidence:
- **All reports** (2025-05-04 to 2025-09-07) uniformly list `1,699,687 triples` in the metadata.  
- Summary sections approximate this as ""about 1.70 million triples"" for readability.

### Exceptions:
- The `Number of triples (query)` field is **unavailable** (`-`) in all reports due to the **missing/offline SPARQL endpoint**, so metadata remains the sole source.  

### Format:
- **Exact count:** `1,699,687` triples.  
- **Approximation:** ≈1.7 million triples.

IR_4,Which is the accuracy score of WordNet?,0.00,"Based on the provided quality analysis reports for WordNet 2.0 (W3C) across multiple dates (2025-05-04 to 2025-09-07), the accuracy score is consistently reported as 0.0 out of 1.0. Below is a detailed breakdown of why this score occurs:

Key Observations from Reports:
Missing SPARQL Endpoint:

All WordNet reports indicate the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint (e.g., ""The SPARQL endpoint is missing"").
This prevents direct query-based evaluation of accuracy metrics.
Intrinsic Accuracy Metrics:

Under the Intrinsic quality category, accuracy checks include:
Triples with empty annotation problem
Triples with white space in annotation
Triples with malformed data type literals problem
Functional properties with inconsistent values
Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties
All these metrics are marked as - (not measurable) due to the inability to query the dataset.
Explicit Accuracy Score:

In every report, the Accuracy subcategory explicitly scores 0.0 with the note:
(Could not be checked as the SPARQL endpoint is missing).

Summary Table:
Report Date	Accuracy Score	Reason
2025-05-04	0.0	SPARQL endpoint missing → Accuracy metrics unmeasurable.
2025-06-01	0.0	SPARQL endpoint missing → Accuracy metrics unmeasurable.
2025-07-13	0.0	SPARQL endpoint missing → Accuracy metrics unmeasurable.
2025-08-03	0.0	SPARQL endpoint missing → Accuracy metrics unmeasurable.
2025-09-07	0.0	SPARQL endpoint missing → Accuracy metrics unmeasurable.
Recommendation:
To improve accuracy measurements, WordNet should:

Provide a functional SPARQL endpoint.
Publish stable RDF dump URLs (currently marked as ""available"" in metadata but not discoverable).
Enable intrinsic checks (e.g., schema validation, data consistency rules) via queryable access.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"Based on the provided quality analysis reports for WordNet 2.0 (W3C) from May to September 2025, here's a summary of its accuracy and key limitations:

Key Findings: Accuracy of WordNet
Accuracy Score Cannot Be Measured:

All reports explicitly state an Accuracy score of 0.0/1. This is not due to confirmed errors but because the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint prevented all intrinsic data checks (including accuracy, consistency, and conciseness).
Without direct access to the RDF data, validators could not verify:
Empty/malformed annotations
Whitespace issues in literals
Functional property inconsistencies
Invalid inverse-functional properties
Indirect Quality Signals:

Believability is high (0.75/1):
The dataset is described as a ""standard conversion of Princeton WordNet to RDF/OWL"" with clear provenance (editors: Mark van Assem, Aldo Gangemi, Guus Schreiber).
Metadata links to W3C documentation (wordnet-rdf).
FAIR scores are moderate (3.3/4):
Strong Findability (DOI, registration) and Reusability (Apache 2.0 license, structured metadata).
Weak Interoperability (0.75/1) due to missing SPARQL endpoint and interlinking verification.
Critical Limitation:

No SPARQL endpoint or downloadable dump:
Although metadata claims an RDF dump exists, no working URL was found. This blocks all data-intrinsic validation.
Recommendations for Improvement
To enable accuracy verification and improve quality:

Provide a working SPARQL endpoint (highest priority).
Publish explicit download links for the RDF dump.
Add human-readable licensing details and contributor metadata.
Enrich interlinking (e.g., SKOS mappings) to improve completeness.
Comparison to Other Datasets
Dataset	Accuracy Score	Key Reason for Score
WordNet 2.0	0.0	Missing SPARQL endpoint ⚠️
NoiPA	0.99966	Operational endpoint + validations passed ✅
LiLa Lemma	0.0	Missing SPARQL endpoint ⚠️
Allie (Life Science)	1.0	Working endpoint + high intrinsic quality ✅
Conclusion
WordNet’s accuracy cannot be validated in its current form (2025 reports). Its structural quality (licensing, documentation) is solid, but operational accessibility is severely lacking. Until a SPARQL endpoint or verified RDF dump is provided, accuracy assertions are speculative.

IR_5,How trustworthy is the Linked Open Camera dataset?,0.5,"Based on the extensive quality assessment reports you provided, I can offer a detailed analysis of dataset trustworthiness—but first, let's clarify a critical point:

🚨 Immediate Discrepancy Alert
There is no ""Linked Open Camera"" dataset in the provided reports. The closest matches by name are:

LiLa Lemma Bank (Latin linguistics)
NoiPA (Italian public administration)
Coronavirus dataset (COVID-19 research)
dblp (computer science bibliography)
CIDOC-CRM (cultural heritage ontology)
If ""Linked Open Camera"" is an alternate name for one of these, please clarify. Below, I analyze trustworthiness generally using these datasets as examples, since common evaluation patterns emerge.

🔍 How Trustworthiness is Evaluated (Key Dimensions)
From the reports, trustworthiness combines these critical metrics:

Trust Category

Believability: Provider reputation (e.g., NoiPA by Italian Gov scored 0.75; Environment Agency data scored 1.0).
Reputation: PageRank-based (dblp had 0.0; LiLa only 0.00047).
Verifiability: Author/publisher transparency (BPR scored 0.11 due to missing metadata).
Security & Accessibility

HTTPS usage (NoiPA lost points here), SPARQL/RDF dump availability (LiLa scored 0.5 due to offline endpoint).
Intrinsic Quality

Consistency: Flaws like ""ontology hijacking"" hurt BPR (0.4/1).
Accuracy: dblp scored 1.0 (excellent accuracy checks).
FAIR Compliance
Higher FAIR scores (e.g., dblp's 3.46/4) signal reusability but don't guarantee trust alone.

📊 Trustworthiness Spectrum in Provided Datasets
Dataset	Trust Score (Normalized)	Key Trust Strengths	Critical Weaknesses
NoiPA	52.47/100	Gov provider, high accuracy	Low interlinking, ontology hijacking
Environment Agency	45.45/100	OGL license, HTTPS, high believability	Missing RDF dump, low labels (<5%)
dblp	~43/100	CC0 license, high conciseness	No HTTPS, low understandability
LiLa Lemma Bank	12.08/100	CC-BY-SA license	No SPARQL, unverifiable metrics
CIDOC-CRM	9.6/100	Theoretical rigor	No operational endpoints, missing licensing
🛡️ Trustworthiness Checklist (Generalized)
To evaluate any dataset (including hypothetical ones like ""Linked Open Camera""):

✅ Provider Credibility
Is it a known institution? (e.g., governments score higher)
✅ License Clarity
Is there a machine-readable license? (CC-BY/OGL > custom licenses)
🛡️ Security
Does it use HTTPS? (critical for public endpoints)
📈 FAIR Metrics
FAIR score > 3/4 indicates strong metadata.
🧪 Consistency Checks
Absence of ""ontology hijacking"" flags is crucial.
🔗 Interlinking
Links to external KGs (e.g., DBpedia) boost reliability.
⚠️ Why ""Linked Open Camera"" Isn't Listed
The reports cover datasets from linguistics, public administration, COVID-19, and academia—no computer vision or camera-related resources appear. If you meant another dataset, please:

Key Observations
Fluctuating Values
The triple count consistently increases over these five reports, with +33 million triples added between May and September 2025. This confirms the dataset is actively updated.

Metadata vs. Reality

Metadata consistently reports 340 million triples (static value).
Query results show dynamic values (412M → 446M), reflecting live data changes.
This discrepancy suggests metadata is outdated or represents a snapshot.
Update Patterns

Stated frequency: Annual (http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/frequency/ANNUAL).
Actual modifications occur more frequently (e.g., 2025-04-17 → 2025-09-01), aligning with triple count changes.

No downtime or outages were documented in the analyzed reports.

Availability Analysis (2025 Reports)
Key Observations
Consistent Uptime:
In all 5 analyzed reports (2025-05-04 to 2025-09-07), the SPARQL endpoint metric explicitly states:

- **Sparql endpoint:** Available

This indicates uninterrupted service during testing windows.

Performance Metrics:
Performance scores remain strong (1.0/1 or 0.975/1), with median latencies ≤185 ms and throughput ≥6 req/s, confirming stable responsiveness.

HTTPS Usage:
While the metric sometimes reports Use HTTPS: False, the endpoint URL (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql) confirms HTTPS is enabled. This may reflect tool misconfiguration rather than actual protocol issues (discussed here).

Supporting Evidence
Report Date	Endpoint Status	Latency	Throughput	HTTPS Reported?
2025-05-04	Available	172 ms	6.0 req/s	❌
2025-06-01	Available	≈130 ms	8.0 req/s	❌
2025-07-13	Available	169 ms	6.0 req/s	❌
2025-08-03	Available	≈130 ms*	8.0 req/s*	❌
2025-09-07	Available	159 ms	6.5 req/s	❌
_Values normalized for readability; minor variations exist across reports.

Caveats
Time-Limited Observations:
Reports only cover specific assessment windows in 2025. While no downtime was detected, transient outages outside these periods cannot be ruled out.

Security Metric Anomaly:
The Use HTTPS metric inconsistently returns False even though the endpoint URL uses HTTPS. This likely stems from validation quirks in the assessment tool, not actual protocol failures:

""Consider ensuring the endpoint or metadata explicitly reflects HTTPS usage... or adjust the metric computation if already using HTTPS.""
— (2025-08-03 Report)

Recommendations
Monitor DBLP Status Page:
Check dblp.org for real-time service announcements.
Use the HTTPS Endpoint:
Workflow integrations should use https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql to ensure encrypted connections.
Retry Mechanisms:
Implement query retries (e.g., exponential backoff) to handle rare transient failures.

DBLP SPARQL Endpoint Availability (2025)
Metric	Score/Status	Details
Sparql endpoint	✅ Available	Explicitly marked as operational in all reports (2025-05-04 to 2025-09-07).
Median latency	⚡ 130-185 ms	Fast responses (<1s threshold), indicating stable performance.
Median throughput	📈 6-8 req/s	Consistent throughput, confirming reliability.
Security (HTTPS)	❌ False	HTTP used (not HTTPS), but endpoint remained accessible.
Dereferenceability	🌐 0.9–1.0	URIs were successfully dereferenced in most checks.
Overall Availability	🏆 1.0/1.0	Perfect score in 5 out of 6 reports (downgraded once due to dump-check quirks).
Key Observations
No documented outages: The endpoint was never flagged as ""Offline"" or ""Missing"" in any report.
High performance: Latency and throughput metrics confirm it handles queries efficiently.
Weakness: HTTPS was not enabled, but this did not impact endpoint uptime.
FAIR score: Achieved 3.46/4 overall, with full marks for Accessibility (A1-D = 1.0).
Recommendation
Use the endpoint confidently: DBLP’s SPARQL service is highly reliable.
Monitor HTTPS adoption: While HTTP works, HTTPS would improve security compliance (metrics flagged this gap).
Check RDF dump status: The endpoint confirmed downloadable dumps exist, but automated dump-checks sometimes failed (Availability of RDF dump (query) = False). Manually verify if dump downloads are critical.

Metadata-Query Mismatch: Metadata claims a dump exists, but operational checks often fail to confirm it.
September 2025 Outage: Dataset became inaccessible entirely (SPARQL endpoint offline, no dump).
Interoperability Gaps: No working download links despite license/FAIR compliance in earlier reports.
🎯 Conclusion
The Allie dataset dump is not reliably ""always up"":

✔️ Operational when accessible: Strong FAIR/licensing when SPARQL works (June-August).
❌ Fragility: Prone to outages (September) and unverified metadata claims.
Recommendation: Verify dump links directly via Allie's portal before relying on automated checks.

TA_4,Is the accuracy of NoiPA constant over time?,No,"To determine whether the accuracy of NoiPA is constant over time, we analyzed its Intrinsic Accuracy scores across five consecutive quality reports from May to September 2025. Here are the findings:

Summary
NoiPA's accuracy score remains extremely stable over time, with minimal fluctuations (± 0.00004) around 0.99966–0.99970 (out of 1.0). These variations are negligible and reflect operational consistency rather than meaningful degradation.

Detailed Analysis 📊
Table 1: Accuracy Scores Over Time
Report Date	Accuracy Score
2025-05-04	0.9997
2025-06-01	0.9997
2025-07-13	0.99966
2025-08-03	0.99966
2025-09-07	0.99966
Key Observations:
Consistency: The scores vary by less than 0.00004 over five months, demonstrating robust stability.
Measurement Context:
Accuracy is derived from checks such as whitespace-free literals, valid datatypes, and functional/inverse-functional property usage.
Metrics scored perfectly (1.0) in most sub-components (e.g., malformed literals, empty annotations).
Minor fluctuations likely stem from data additions/updates (e.g., new triples with whitespace annotations).
Comparison with Other Metrics 🔍
While accuracy is stable, other dimensions like consistency (scores: 0.40) or FAIR metrics (scores: 2.57–2.76) show greater variability due to ontology-hijacking warnings and interlinking issues. Accuracy stands out as a persistent strength.

Dimension	Trend	Notes
Consistency	Fluctuates (~0.40)	Affected by undefined terms, ontology misuse
Interlinking	Near-zero (0.000004)	Low linkage to external datasets
Performance	Stable (0.06–0.22s)	Reliable SPARQL endpoint latency
Conclusion ✅
Yes, NoiPA’s accuracy is effectively constant over time. Its near-perfect scores indicate rigorous data validation processes and stability in intrinsic data quality, despite weaknesses in other dimensions (e.g., interlinking, consistency).

Recommendations:

Address consistency issues (e.g., ontology hijacking).
Improve interlinking to boost FAIR/I3-D scores without compromising accuracy.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,

Key Observations
Near-Perfect Scores:

All reports show accuracy scores > 0.9996 (99.96%+), indicating exceptional data cleanliness.
Critical checks (empty annotations, malformed literals, property consistency) consistently score 1.0.
Minor Variation:

A negligible decrease in whitespace handling (from 0.9985 to 0.9983) between June and July 2025, causing the accuracy score to dip from 0.9997 to 0.99966.
This change is statistically insignificant and reflects robustness against data-entry errors.
Stability Post-July:

Scores stabilize at 0.99966 for the last three reports, confirming no progressive degradation.
Comparison with Other Datasets
dblp maintains perfect accuracy (1.0) in all reports.
Coronavirus KG also scores 1.0 consistently.
NoiPA’s slight deviation is trivial in practice and still ranks among the most accurate KGs analyzed.
Conclusion
NoiPA's accuracy demonstrates strong temporal consistency, with no meaningful declines observed. Minor variations are attributable to marginal changes in whitespace handling, likely due to incremental data updates. Overall, the KG maintains exceptionally high data quality standards over time.

RDF dumps are declared as available in metadata (Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1).
Example URLs:

https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples
https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz
Download Links Advertised
Metadata explicitly marks RDF dumps as downloadable (Availability for download (metadata) = 1).

URI Dereferenceability
HTTP URIs resolve successfully in tests (URIs Deferenceability = 1.0), ensuring resources are machine-accessible.

⚠️ Minor Weakness (No Impact on Score)
Endpoint-based dump verification fails:
While dumps are advertised in metadata, SPARQL queries could not independently confirm their online status (Availability of RDF dump (query) = False).
This does not penalize the score because metadata declarations are prioritized.
📊 Comparison to Other Datasets
Dataset	SPARQL Endpoint?	RDF Dump Declared?	URIs Dereferenceable	Availability Score
DBLP	✅ Yes	✅ Yes (metadata)	✅ 1.0	1.0
LiLa Lemma Bank	❌ No	✅ Yes	❌ Untested	≤0.5
Coronavirus Dataset	✅ Yes	❌ No	✅ ~0.96	≤0.74
WordNet 2.0 (W3C)	❌ No	✅ Yes	❌ 0.0	≤0.5
💡 Why This Matters
DBLP meets all critical criteria for accessibility under the FAIR principles:

Findability: Persistent identifiers and working endpoints.
Accessibility: Zero-click access via SPARQL + backups via dumps.
Interoperability: Standard RDF formats (NTriples, TTL).
Reusability: CC0 licensing and clear reuse policies.
This robust infrastructure ensures researchers can access the dataset even if one access point (e.g., SPARQL) experiences downtime.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Analysis: Does a Score of 0 in ""Amount of Data"" Mean the Dataset is Empty?
Short Answer:
No, a score of 0 for ""Amount of Data"" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty. It indicates that all underlying metrics used to compute the score are either missing, invalid, or zero, which could imply emptiness, but requires contextual verification (e.g., SPARQL endpoint failure, metadata gaps).

Key Details from the Documentation:
Metric Composition
The ""Amount of Data"" score is a linear combination of:

Number of triples (metadata)
Number of triples (query)
Number of entities
Number of entities (regex)
Number of properties
Output: [0,1], where 1 is best.

Failure Cases for Metrics
Each sub-metric returns:

An integer (if retrievable),
- if data is missing/irretrievable,
Or False/empty if no data exists (e.g., SPARQL errors).
Score Calculation Logic
If all sub-metrics are -, False, or 0, the final score would be 0.
Examples from the reports:

Empty dataset: All triples/entities = 0 → Score = 0.
Unretrievable data: All metrics = - → Score = 0 (even if data exists).
Scenarios Leading to Score = 0:
Scenario	Example Metrics	Implication
Truly empty dataset	Triples (metadata) = 0, Triples (query) = 0, Entities = 0	Valid score of 0 → Dataset is empty.
Partially missing metrics	Triples (metadata) = -, Triples (query) = -, Entities = -	Score = 0 despite possible data presence (technical failure).
Mixed failures	Triples (metadata) = 7.1×10 
7
 , other metrics = -	Score not 0 (higher weight on retrievable metrics).
Case Study: Coronavirus Dataset (Score ≈0.67)
Number of triples (metadata): 70,870,184
Number of triples (query): 80,929,914
Number of entities: - (failed retrieval)
Despite missing some metrics, the score 

=0 due to valid triple counts.

Conclusion:
A score of 0 suggests no meaningful data was measurable, but this may arise from:

Total emptiness (rare),
Metadata/SPARQL endpoint failures,
All retrievable metrics evaluating to 0 or invalid.
Action: Cross-check raw metrics (triple counts, entities) to confirm whether emptiness or technical issues caused the score.",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the Amount of Data metrics documentation and analysis of the provided dataset reports, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. Here's why:

Key Interpretation
The amount-of-data score is a linear combination of multiple metrics:

Number of triples (metadata)
Number of triples (query)
Number of entities
Number of entities (regex-counted)
Number of properties
A score of 0 occurs when:

All retrievable metrics report 0, or
All metrics are missing/unretrievable (represented as -), effectively treated as 0 in calculations.
Critical Observations
Missing data ≠ No data
If metrics like Number of triples (query) return - (e.g., SPARQL endpoint offline), this contributes 0 to the score, even if the dataset actually has data.

Partial missing data lowers the score
Example:

Triples (metadata): - (missing)
Triples (query): - (missing)
Entities: - (missing)
Score = 0 even if the dataset contains data that couldn’t be measured.
Zero counts imply emptiness
If all metrics explicitly return 0 (e.g., Triples (metadata): 0, Triples (query): 0), the dataset is confirmed empty.

Examples from Reports
dblp

Metric: Number of triples (metadata) = 0
Query-based count: 1.44 billion triples
Score ≠ 0 → 0.333 (not all metrics failed).
LiLa Lemma Bank

Triples (metadata): 1,699,687
Triples (query): - (SPARQL missing)
Score = 0.333 (partial data succeeds).
Hypothetical 0-score case:

All metrics report - or 0 → Score = 0
This could mean:
Dataset is truly empty, or
Measurement tools failed entirely (e.g., dead SPARQL endpoint, corrupt metadata).
Conclusion
Scenario	Amount-of-Data Score	Dataset Reality
All metrics = 0	0	Truly empty
All metrics = -	0	Unknown (likely inaccessible data)
Mix of 0/-	0	Likely empty (but partially unverified)
Thus, a score of 0 indicates absence of measurable data, not necessarily absence of data itself. Further investigation (e.g., manual checks) is required to distinguish between empty, inaccessible, or partially broken datasets.",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Yes, an Availability Score of 1 generally implies that both the SPARQL endpoint and RDF dump are confirmed to be operational, based on how the score is computed from the metrics. Here’s the formal breakdown:

Key Requirements for an Availability Score = 1
SPARQL Endpoint:

Sparql endpoint: Available
(Endpoint responds to queries)
RDF Dump Availability (Metadata):

Availability of RDF dump (metadata): 1
(Explicitly marked as online in metadata)
RDF Dump Availability (SPARQL Check):

Availability of RDF dump (query): True
(Dump confirmed available via the SPARQL endpoint)
Download Availability:

Availability for download (metadata): 1
(Metadata confirms downloadable dump)
(Note: Query-based download checks might not always be required)
URIs Deferenceability:

URIs Deferenceability: 1.0
(URIs resolve, assumes endpoint is working)
Exceptions/Observations from Dataset Reports
Inconsistent Dump Checks
While the score aims to require all metrics (endpoint + dumps) to be functional, real-world examples (e.g., dblp) show scores of 1.0/1 even with Availability of RDF dump (query): False in metadata.
→ This suggests metadata-based dump indicators may outweigh SPARQL checks in specific implementations.

""Availability for download"" Metrics
The combination of Availability of RDF dump (metadata): 1 + Availability for download (metadata): 1 is treated as sufficient in some scoring logic, even if direct download URLs aren’t discovered (e.g., WordNet 2.0’s 0.5/1 despite no URLs).

Summary
An Availability Score of 1/1 functionally signifies:

✅ SPARQL endpoint is working
✅ RDF dump exists per metadata
🔼 Sometimes requires SPAROL-based dump verification (context-dependent)
❌ Cannot be achieved without a SPARQL endpoint
Low scores (e.g., WordNet 2.0’s 0.5/1) highlight missing endpoints or failed dump validation.

Example:


Availability score = 1.0/1
Metrics:
  - Sparql endpoint: Available
  - Availability of RDF dump (metadata): 1
  - Availability of RDF dump (query): True  # Often critical
  - URIs Deferenceability: 1.0",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"Based on the documentation provided, the Availability score of 1 indicates that both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF dump are confirmed to be operational, but only as declared in the metadata. Here's the breakdown:

Yes, if:
SPARQL endpoint is ""Available"" (online and responsive).
RDF dump is marked ""1"" (online) in metadata.
URIs Deferenceability = 1.0 (all URIs dereferenceable).
However:
The RDF dump's query-based status (via SPARQL) might still be False (e.g., if the dump exists but isn't explicitly confirmed by query). The availability score prioritizes metadata declarations over SPARQL checks.
Other factors (e.g., HTTPS usage) do not directly affect availability but are part of the Security score.
Key Metrics for Availability Score (1/1):
SPARQL Endpoint: Available (mandatory).
RDF Dump (metadata): 1 (via metadata/VoID).
Download Availability (metadata): 1.
URIs Dereferenceability: 1.0.
Example from Reports:

# dblp (2025-08-03) – Score: 1.0/1
- Sparql endpoint: Available
- Availability of RDF dump (metadata): 1  
- URIs Deferenceability: 1.0
Why RDF Dump Checks via Query May Still Show False:
Sub-metrics like Availability of RDF dump (query) are not part of the availability score calculation when metadata already confirms the dump exists.
Metadata-driven flags (e.g., ""this dump exists"") override SPARQL-based checks in the scoring logic.
Formula:

If Licensing = 1 (best score), does it confirm an open license?
✅ Yes, a perfect score (1/1) indicates a confirmed open license is used. Here's why:

Scoring Components:
The licensing score is determined by whether:

license machine readable (metadata) OR license machine readable (query) returns a valid license URI
license human readable (optional) boosts the score if present.

if only one machine-readable source found

​
 
License Detection Criteria:

Machine-readable checks only pass if licenses are in standard open license URIs (e.g., cc-zero, cc-by, apache-2.0 from opendefinition.org/licenses).
Example valid licenses seen in reports:

http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero (CC0 1.0 Universal)
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by (CC Attribution 4.0)
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 (Apache 2.0)
What a Score of 1 Means:

Open license confirmed: All machine-readable checks passed (query + metadata), and URIs point to recognized open licenses.
The system does not validate arbitrary URIs – only accepted open licenses yield a score >0.
Key Observations from Reports:
dblp:
Licensing = 0.5/1 since only CC0 was found via metadata/query (human-readable missing). Still open.
Coronavirus Dataset:
Licensing = 1.0/1 (CC-BY found via both metadata/query + human-readable confirmation).
False Positives? Nearly impossible – proprietary/custom licenses would return False and score 0.0.
Final Answer:
A licensing score of 1/1 guarantees an open license, as the framework only validates standardized, machine-readable open licenses. Lower scores (e.g., 0.5) still confirm openness but indicate partial metadata coverage.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,

License Score Interpretation
The Licensing score is computed as a linear combination of individual licensing metrics, with a maximum value of 1 indicating perfect compliance. The key takeaway is:

A Licensing score of 1 requires all relevant licensing criteria to be met:
Machine-readable license detected in metadata (e.g., CC0, CC BY, etc.).
Machine-readable license confirmed via query (if SPARQL endpoint is available).
Human-readable license explicitly provided (e.g., a dedicated license page).
Key Examples
Coronavirus Dataset (Score: 1.0)

License machine readable (metadata): CC-BY
License machine readable (query): CC-BY 4.0
License human readable: True
Result: License score = 1.0 (fully open license with complete attribution).
dblp (Score: 0.5)

Machine-readable CC0 detected in metadata/query, but no human-readable license (License human redeable: -).
Result: Partial compliance reduces the score.
LiLa Lemma Bank (Score: 0.5)

Machine-readable CC BY-SA detected, but human-readable license missing.
Answer to Your Question
Yes, if the licensing score is 1, it means an open license is actively used and fully documented (machine-readable + human-readable).
Scores <1 indicate partial compliance (e.g., open license detected but documentation incomplete).
How the Scoring Works
The licensing dimension is graded based on three sub-metrics:

Machine-readable (metadata)
Machine-readable (query)
Human-readable
A score of 1 requires all applicable metrics to return positive results (e.g., valid license URLs or True for human-readable).

Formula (Simplified)
Licensing Score= 
3
(Metadata License + Query License + Human License)
​
 
Each sub-metric contributes equally, with missing values reducing the score. For example:

Missing human-readable license:  
3
1+1+0
​
 =0.66 (rounded to 0.5 in reports).
Recommendation
To achieve a licensing score of 1:

Declare a standard open license (CC0, CC BY, etc.) in metadata.
Ensure the SPARQL endpoint returns the license if queried.
Provide a human-readable license page (e.g., /license).
This guarantees full compliance with FAIR principles for licensing.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"Based on the documentation, the answer is yes: if the Verifiability score is exactly 1, it means that all provider-related information (as defined in the metrics) is fully present and valid. Here's why:

Key Metrics Contributing to Verifiability Score
The Verifiability dimension consists of six metrics:

Author (query): Must return a list of authors (not [] or -)
Author (metadata): Must return a valid string (not False or absent)
Contributor: Must return a list of contributors (not [] or -)
Publisher: Must return a list of publishers (not [] or -)
Sources: Must return a valid string (not False)
Signed: Must return True (dataset is signed)
Score Calculation
The Verifiability score is computed as a linear combination of these metrics. For the aggregate score to reach the maximum value of 1, all individual metrics must return their optimal outputs (as defined above).

Example Failure Cases
If any single metric fails, the overall score drops below 1:

If Author (metadata) returns False → score < 1.
If Signed returns False → score < 1.
If Contributor returns [] → score < 1.
Conclusion
A Verifiability score of 1 explicitly confirms that:

Authors, contributors, and publishers are fully specified (via both query and metadata).
Source contact information (URL, name, email) is provided.
The dataset is cryptographically signed.
This aligns with the documentation's assertion that the best value for the Verifiability score is 1, which is only achievable when all provider-related information is complete and correctly reported.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"Answer:

Yes, if the verifiability score is 1, it means all provider information required by the verifiability dimension is fully available and complete, as defined in the metrics documentation. Here's why:

Key Verifiability Metrics
The verifiability score is computed as a linear combination of the following metrics:

Author (query/metadata): Presence of author(s) in the dataset's metadata or endpoint.
Best score: List of authors provided (not [], False, or -).
Contributor: Presence of contributor(s).
Best score: Non-empty list ([] fails).
Publisher: Stated publisher of the data.
Best score: Non-empty list (e.g., ['PublisherName']).
Sources: Website, name, and email of the source.
Best score: String with all three (False fails).
Signed: Digital signature status.
Best score: True (dataset is signed).
Why ""1"" Means Full Availability
A verifiability score of 1 requires every metric above to achieve its maximum value:
All authors, contributors, and publishers are explicitly listed.
Sources are fully described (URL, name, email).
The dataset is signed (Signed: True).
If any of these metrics are missing or incomplete (e.g., empty contributor list, unsigned dataset), the score will be <1.
Example from Reports
The dataset NoiPA (normalized score 52.47) achieved a verifiability score of ~0.50 (2025-07-13) because:

Author (query): Provided (['https://.../metadata/Mef']).
Author (metadata): Incomplete (Name: absent).
Contributor: Absent ([]).
Sources: Partial (Email: black@email.it but lacks full provenance).
Publisher: Present (['https://.../metadata/Mef']).
Signed: False.
Conclusion: A verifiability score of 1 is only possible if all provider information (authors, contributors, publishers, sources, signatures) is explicitly declared and complete.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
