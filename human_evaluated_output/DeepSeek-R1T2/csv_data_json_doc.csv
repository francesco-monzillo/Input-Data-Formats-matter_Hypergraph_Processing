IR_4,Which is the accuracy score of WordNet?,0.00,"The Accuracy Score for WordNet (KG id: w3c-wordnet) is 0.0 across all recorded entries in the dataset. Here's a summary:

Key Details:
Dataset Name: WordNet 2.0 (W3C)
KG id: w3c-wordnet
Accuracy Score (Intrinsic_Accuracy_Accuracy score):
All entries consistently report 0.0.
Analysis Dates:
2025-05-04, 2025-06-01, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03, 2025-09-07
Context:
The Accuracy Score is defined as:
""Overall score for the accuracy dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual accuracy metrics scores.""
Scale: [0, 1] (Best value: 1).


{""Accuracy score"":

    ""input"": ""Accuracy metrics scores"",
    ""output"": ""[0,1]. Best value: 1.""
  }
}
Notes:
The score 0.0 suggests that WordNet's data fails to meet criteria measured by intrinsic accuracy metrics (e.g., triples with empty annotations, malformed literals, or invalid property usage).
For deeper analysis, investigate individual accuracy metrics like:
Triples with empty annotation problem
Triples with malformed data type literals problem
Functional properties with inconsistent values.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"Based on the provided dataset for WordNet 2.0 (W3C), here's a detailed accuracy assessment. The dataset evaluates multiple quality dimensions, with a specific focus on intrinsic accuracy and related metrics:

1. Intrinsic Accuracy Score
Score: 0.0 (out of 1.0) across all entries
(Lower values indicate potential data quality issues)
Components:
Triples with empty annotation problem: 0.0
Triples with white space in annotation: 0.0
Triples with malformed data type literals: 0.0
Functional properties with inconsistent values: 0.0
Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties: 0.0
🔍 Interpretation: While the absence of detectable errors in these categories suggests compliance with RDF structural standards, the overall score of 0.0 indicates no measurable ""positive"" accuracy signals as defined by this dataset. This may imply that WordNet's RDF conversion meets basic syntactic validity but lacks additional accuracy-enhancing features (e.g., validation beyond schema checks).

2. Trust and Believability
Believability Score: 0.75 (out of 1.0)
Description:
Maintained by W3C (trusted entity).
Clear documentation of conversion methodology.
Not on a ""trusted provider list"" (isTrustedProviderList: False).
Trust Value: 5.025×10 
−5
  (PageRank-derived metric).
📌 Key Point: Despite the low accuracy score, WordNet benefits from institutional credibility.

3. Complementary Metrics Affecting Usability
Interoperability & Versatility:
Languages: Not supported (Languages (query/metadata): -/{}).
Serialization Formats: Limited to application/rdf+xml and application/zip (Versatility Score: 0.333).
Dynamicity:
Age of Data: Undefined (Currency Score: 0.0).
No SPARQL endpoint (Sparql endpoint: -), limiting live query capabilities.
4. Overall Quality
Normalized Quality Score:
3.3 (2025-05-04) → Drops to 3.11 (2025-08-03) out of 100.
Weak Areas:
Performance: 0.0 (no SPARQL endpoint).
Interlinking: 0.0 (isolated from other datasets).
Key Insights
Accuracy in Context:
The 0.0 accuracy score reflects technical RDF validity but does not assess lexical/semantic correctness of WordNet's content. This metric is narrowly scoped to data representation issues (e.g., malformed literals), not linguistic accuracy.
Limitations for Modern Use:
Absence of a SPARQL endpoint, multilingual support, and interlinking reduces practical utility in semantic applications.
Credibility vs. Modern Standards:
While historically authoritative, the RDF version lacks features expected in contemporary knowledge graphs (e.g., FAIR compliance scores are low).
Recommendations
Supplement with NLP Validation: Use domain-specific benchmarks (e.g., word-sense disambiguation tasks) to evaluate lexical accuracy.
Enhance Metadata: Add multilingual labels and interlinks to boost interoperability.
Monitor Updates: The dataset's static nature (Dataset dynamicity_Currency_Modification date: -) suggests infrequent updates.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
IR_5,What is the trust value of the Linked Open Camera dataset?,0.5,"Based on the provided dataset entries, there is no record for a dataset named ""Linked Open Camera"" in the submitted data. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Key Observations:
Dataset Absence: All entries were reviewed (e.g., CIDOC-CRM, dblp-kg, micro-coronavirus, LemmaBank, etc.), but no dataset with the name ""Linked Open Camera"" or a semantically close variant was identified.

Trust Values in Available Datasets:
The datasets listed have Trust_Believability_Trust value scores as follows:

Key Observations:
Consistent Value:
All entries report exactly 340 million triples for Number of triples (query), despite different analysis dates spanning 5 months.

Dataset Dynamicity:
The dataset's update frequency is marked as annual (http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/frequency/ANNUAL). Since the analysis window (May–September 2025) likely falls within the same annual cycle, the triple count remains static.

No Indication of Dynamic Updates:

There are no observed incremental changes in the triple count.
If the dataset were updated dynamically, the triple count would likely vary (e.g., 439,796,613 for Number of entities counted with regex varies slightly).
Conclusion:
For the analyzed period, the number of triples retrieved via NoiPA's SPARQL endpoint is always the same (340,000,000). This reflects a static snapshot of the dataset within its annual update cycle. Changes would only be expected after a new dataset version is published.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,

2025-08-03	0.99966
2025-07-13	0.99966
2025-06-01	0.9997
Key Observations:
Near-Constant Value
The accuracy score remains extremely stable, ranging between 0.99966 and 0.9997 (a variation of 0.00004). This indicates negligible change in accuracy over the observed period.

Metric Definition
The accuracy score evaluates issues like:

Triples with malformed datatype literals
Empty/whitespace annotation problems
Functional/inverse-functional property violations
Higher values closer to 1.0 suggest fewer inaccuracies.
Dynamicity Context
The dataset has an annual update frequency (Dataset update frequency = http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/frequency/ANNUAL), meaning major data changes occur yearly. This aligns with the observed stability of accuracy between updates.

Conclusion:
Yes, the accuracy of NoiPA is effectively constant over time within the analyzed timeframe. Minor fluctuations (e.g., 0.99966 vs. 0.9997) are statistically insignificant for most practical applications.

Should the update frequency or verification methods change, reassessment may be necessary. For now, NoiPA maintains highly stable accuracy.

Supporting Metrics:
Currency Score Stability:
Consistent Currency score values (0.99165, 0.99135, 0.99135, 0.99165) further validate temporal consistency.
No Major Data Shifts:
The Number of triples varies slightly (412M to 439M), but structural integrity (accuracy) remains unaffected.
FAIR Scores:
All FAIR score values stay at 2.76 or 2.57, confirming stable metadata/accessibility practices.
Limitations:
Analysis covers only a 3-month window (May–August 2025).
Long-term trends beyond 2025 require future data.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,

The dataset contains various metrics about accessibility, licensing, currency, and representational features, but none explicitly track historical uptime.

Key Observations:
Timestamps Present:

Last Modification Date: Recent modification dates (e.g., 2025-05-04, 2025-09-07), but these are analysis dates, not uptime tracking.
Age of Data: The oldest data (Dataset dynamicity_Currency_Age of data) is from 2011-08-01, but this refers to content age, not server uptime.
Availability Indicators:

RDF Dump Availability:
Accessibility_Availability_Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1 (available).
Accessibility_Availability_Availability of RDF dump (query) = False (not available for querying).
This only reflects current status, not historical continuity.
Uptime Inference:

Endpoint Stability: The SPARQL endpoint (http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql) is marked as ""Available"" in all records, but no uptime history is provided.
Dynamicity: The dataset is updated monthly (Dataset dynamicity_Timeliness_Dataset update frequency = ['Monthly']), but this doesn't equate to uninterrupted availability.
Conclusion:
The dataset does not provide sufficient information to determine the exact uninterrupted uptime duration of the data dump. To calculate this, you would need server logs or external monitoring tools (e.g., UptimeRobot) tracking the service's availability over time.

1. SPARQL Endpoint Availability
The DBLP SPARQL endpoint is marked as Available (via Accessibility_Availability_Sparql endpoint).
Endpoint URL: https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql is functional and queriable.
2. RDF Dump Availability
Metadata Availability: The RDF dump metadata is available (Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1).

Below is the detailed breakdown:

Key Reasons for Availability Score = 1
SPARQL Endpoint Availability

The DBLP SPARQL endpoint (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql) is marked as Available across all entries.
A working SPARQL endpoint ensures real-time query access to the dataset.
Availability of RDF Dump (Metadata)

The metric Accessibility_Availability_Availability of RDF dump (metadata) is rated 1 (indicating the metadata RDF dump is available for download).
Downloadable metadata is provided via URLs like https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz.
Fail-Proof Data Access

Distributed RDF dumps ensure redundancy (e.g., DOI-based and direct URLs) even if one source is unavailable.
While Availability for download (query) is False, this refers to query-specific dump availability, not the general data dump.
FAIR Compliance

For FAIR metrics, the dataset scores:
F2a-M - Metadata availability via standard primary sources = 1 (metadata accessible via standard interfaces).
A1-D Working access point(s) = 1 (operational SPARQL endpoint + accessible data dump).
How the Availability Score is Calculated
The availability score is derived from a weighted combination of metrics such as:

Online SPARQL endpoint (required for real-time access).
Persistent RDF dump availability (ensures offline/data backup access).
Downloadability (direct URLs or structured archives).
Formula Structure (Simplified)
Availability Score=w 
1
​
 ⋅(SPARQL Availability)+w 
2
​
 ⋅(RDF Dump)+⋯
(where weights sum to 1)
DBLP achieves 100% because:

SPARQL endpoint works.
Metadata RDF dumps are downloadable.
It provides multiple download paths.

Metric	DBLP	Other Dataset (e.g., BPR)
SPARQL Endpoint Online	✅	⚠️ (sometimes timeout)
RDF Dump (Metadata)	✅	❌
Persistent Download URLs	✅	❌

This robustness justifies the score of 1 for DBLP compared to partial scores in other datasets.

Conclusion
The DBLP dataset maximizes availability by providing both real-time access (SPARQL) and static RDF dumps, fulfilling strict FAIR data principles. Its redundancy mechanisms (DOI + direct URLs) ensure long-term accessibility, earning the top score. 🔍✅",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for the ""Amount of data"" dimension does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty. Here's why:

Key Analysis
Score Definition:

The Amount of data score is a normalized metric (∈[0,1]) computed as a linear combination of multiple submetrics:
Number of triples (metadata/query)
Number of entities
Number of properties
Number of entities counted via regex
Observations from Data:


['environment-agency-bathing-water-quality', ..., 'Number of triples (metadata)': 8,735,962, 'Amount of data score': 0.0]
['bbc-programmes', ..., 'Number of triples (query)': 60,000,000, 'Amount of data score': 0.25]
['bpr', ..., 'Number of triples (metadata)': 366,800, 'Amount of data score': 0.5]
Datasets with non-zero triples can still score 0 (e.g., 8.7M triples but score 0).
Even extremely large datasets (e.g., 60M triples) may only score moderately (0.25).
Interpretation:

A score of 0 indicates poor performance across the composite metrics, not absence of data.
Possible reasons for low scores despite data presence:
Imbalanced distribution (e.g., many triples but few properties/entities).
Low scores in specific submetrics (e.g., missing regex-based entity counts).
Mathematical Representation
The score is computed as:
Amount of data score=∑ 
i
​
 w 
i
​
 ⋅Metric 
i
​
 
where w 
i
​
  are weights, and Metric 
i
​
  are normalized submetrics (e.g.,  
max possible
num. properties
​
 ). A score of 0 reflects universally low submetric values, not zero data.

Summary

Here's why:

Key Explanation
Composite Metric:
The amount-of-data score is a weighted combination of multiple metrics (e.g., number of triples, entities, properties, etc.), not just raw data size.

A score of 0 indicates poor performance across these metrics, such as:
Missing RDF dumps (Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 0 or -).
Unavailable SPARQL endpoints (Accessibility_Availability_Sparql endpoint = -).
Low/no counts for key metrics (e.g., Number of triples (query) = -).
Examples from Data:

environment-agency-bathing-water-quality:
Has 8,735,962 triples (metadata), but scores 0.0 because:
RDF dump availability = 0.
SPARQL endpoint status = - (missing/offline).
w3c-wordnet:
Has 710,000 triples (metadata) but scores 0.0 due to missing interoperability/licensing metrics.
When Would Data Truly Be ""Empty""?
A dataset would only have no data if all the following are true:

Number of triples (metadata) = 0 or -.
Number of triples (query) = 0 or -.
Number of entities = 0 or -.

Here's the breakdown:

Key Evidence
Definition of ""Availability Score"" (Availability score):

Computed as a linear combination of individual availability metrics (e.g., SPARQL endpoint status, RDF dump status).
Output: [0,1], where 1 is the best value (both access points functional).
SPARQL Endpoint Metric (Sparql endpoint):

Output values: Offline, Available, or - (missing).
A score of 1 requires the endpoint to be Available.
RDF Dump Metric (Availability of RDF dump (query)):

Output values: False (offline), True (online), or - (missing).
A score of 1 requires dumps to be True.

Output:
1: Operational SPARQL endpoint and accessible data dump.
0.5: Only one is accessible.
0: Neither works.",1,0.5,0.5,availability is not formed by onlt sparql endpoint availability and rdf dump,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"The Availability score of 1 indicates that at least one of the following is true:

The SPARQL endpoint is operational, or
The RDF data dump is available for download.
It does not require both to be available to achieve a score of 1. This conclusion is based on the scoring logic defined in the A1-D Working access point(s) metric, where:

A score of 1 means either the SPARQL endpoint or the RDF dump is accessible.
Key Supporting Evidence:
Metric Definition (A1-D):

Output: 1 = operational SPARQL endpoint or accessible data dump.
Source:

{""A1-D Working access point(s)"":{""output"":""1: operational SPARQL or accessible data dump; 0.5: accessible SPARQL endpoint or data dump; 0: otherwise""}}

dblp-kg: Score 1 with working SPARQL endpoint but no downloadable dump (URL for download the dataset = []).
w3c-wordnet: Score 1 with no SPARQL endpoint but available RDF dump (Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1).
Formal Expression:
The score follows this logic:

Availability Score={

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Based on the provided metadata and scoring definitions:

License Indicator (R1.1):
The field Unknown_FAIR_R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source uses a binary output:

1: License is explicitly reported.
0: License is not explicitly reported.
This does not inherently confirm whether the license is open or proprietary—only that a detectable license exists.

Observed License Types:
In datasets where R1.1 = 1, the actual licenses are:

Apache License 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
CC-BY 4.0 (http://w3id.org/italia/controlled-vocabulary/licences/A21_CCBY40)
Both are open licenses.
Licensing Score:
The Licensing score (range: [0, 1]) is computed holistically from multiple metrics. A value of 1 indicates ideal licensing practices (e.g., machine-readability, human-readability, clear attribution). Lower values imply deficiencies.

Key Conclusion:
While R1.1 = 1 confirms a license is explicitly provided, the examples show that detected licenses are open. Thus, a value of 1 for the license parameter strongly suggests an open license is used, though strictly speaking, it confirms detectability rather than openness.

E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Answer
Based on the provided dataset and metadata descriptions:

If ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" is set to 1:

This does not explicitly confirm an open license.
The metric R1.1 has a binary output:
1 = License is explicitly reported (exists and is retrievable).
0 = License is not reported.
It only validates the presence/availability of a license, not its openness (e.g., CC-BY, Apache 2.0).
If the composite ""Licensing score"" is 1:

This does not guarantee an open license either.
The Licensing score is a linear combination of licensing-related metrics (range [0,1]), where 1 represents the best possible score for license availability and machine-readability.
While a score of 1 suggests strong adherence to licensing best practices (e.g., licenses are well-documented and retrievable), it doesn’t inherently confirm the license is open.
Openness would depend on the specific license terms (e.g., Apache 2.0, CC-BY-SA), which must be checked separately (e.g., via the License machine redeable (metadata) field).
Key Observations from Example Datasets:
w3c-wordnet reports https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 (an open license) and has a Licensing score of 0.75.
NoiPA reports https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ (an open license) and has a Licensing score of 0.75.
A licensing metric value of 1 only confirms technical compliance, not license type. To verify openness, inspect the actual license URL or description.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"From the provided dataset and metadata definitions, the answer to whether ""if verifiability is set to 1, all information about providers are set"" is No. Here's the detailed reasoning:

Key Observations
Verifiability Metrics:
The verifiability dimension comprises these metrics:

Author (query)
Author (metadata)
Contributor
Publisher
Sources
Signed
Computed score: Trust_Verifiability_Verifiability score
Score Definition:

The Verifiability score is a linear combination of individual metrics, normalized to [0,1].
Even if the score is 1, it doesn't imply every provider-related field has data. For example, some metrics could compensate for others.
Evidence from Data:

W3C WordNet:
Verifiability score = 0.75 (not 1), yet most verifiability fields (Author, Contributor) are marked - (missing).

['w3c-wordnet', ..., '0.75', '-', '-', 'Name: absent...', '-', '-', ...]
Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality:
Verifiability score = 0.5, and Sources explicitly states False.

['environment-agency...', ..., '1.0', '-', '-', 'False', ...]
No dataset in the sample achieves Verifiability score = 1.
Mathematical Perspective
The verifiability score v is calculated as:
v=f(w 
1
​
 ⋅Author+w 
2
​
 ⋅Publisher+…)
where ∑w 
i
​
 =1.

Key point: A perfect score (v=1) could theoretically arise even if some metrics are incomplete (e.g., missing Contributor if its weight w 
i
​
  is low).
Conclusion
A verifiability score of 1 does not guarantee all provider fields are populated—it reflects an aggregated (possibly weighted) assessment of the available metadata.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available. Here's why:

Core Insight 🔍
The verifiability score (V 
score
​
 ) measures completeness for specific provider-related metadata fields, not the entire spectrum of provider information. It is calculated as:

V 
score
​
 = 
N
∑(Verifiability metrics)
​
 
where:

Numerator: Sum of scores for verifiability-specific metrics (e.g., author, contributor, publisher fields).
Denominator: Total number of verifiability metrics considered (N).
A score of 1 means all verifiability-related fields are populated, but not necessarily other provider details (e.g., licensing, trust lists).

Key Distinctions 🗝️
Verifiability-scoped fields only:

Author (query/metadata)
Contributor
Publisher
Sources
Signed status
Non-verifiability fields (unaffected):

License metadata (Accessibility_Licensing_*)
Trust scores (Trust_Reputation_*, Trust_Believability_*)
Provider trustlists (Is on a trusted provider list)
Dataset Evidence 📊
Examples where V 
score
​
 =1 but provider info is incomplete:

KG ID	Verifiability Score	Author (query)	Source Field	Signed?	Notes
allie-abbreviation-...	1.0	[]	Web:http://allie.dbcls.jp/...	False	Author not listed, but score remains 1.0
dblp-kg	1.0	[]	Web:https://dblp.org...	False	Author missing, but verifiability uses other fields.
These are still scored as 1 because verifiability only requires partial coverage of its defined fields.

Critical Rule ⚠️
Verifiability score ≠ holistic provider transparency. It assesses:

Verifiability⊂Provider Metadata
