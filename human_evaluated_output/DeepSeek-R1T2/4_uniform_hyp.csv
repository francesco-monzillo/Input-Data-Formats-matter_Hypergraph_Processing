[""0.000000"", ""Accuracy score"", ""w3c-wordnet"", ""2025-08-03""]
📊 Contextual Interpretation
While the accuracy metric is consistently zero, other scores suggest partial strengths:

Completeness/Interlinking: 0.000000
Performance: 0.000000
Believability: 0.800000 (high confidence in metadata quality).
Verifiability: 0.331667 (moderate provenance tracking).
Normalized Score: 12.075–13.325 (on a non-specified scale).
🧠 Key Observations
Potential Methodology Gap:
The zero accuracy score might indicate missing evaluation data or incompatible metrics (e.g., WordNet's structure doesn't align with the accuracy test framework).

Alternative Quality Indicators:
The dataset reports minimal reuse of FAIR vocabularies (I2 Use of FAIR vocabularies = 0.000000), suggesting adherence to standardized ontologies is low.

Conclusion
WordNet's accuracy is rated 0.000000 in this dataset, but this could reflect methodological limitations rather than inherent flaws. For practical NLP tasks, WordNet remains empirically validated for lexical tasks (synonymy, hyponymy), though newer resources like BERT or Word2Vec outperform it in contextual semantics.

Metadata Dump Availability

Consistently Available:
Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.000000 appears on multiple dates (2025-05-04, 2025-06-01, 2025-07-13, etc.), indicating reliable access to the metadata dump.
Download URL:
FTP paths like ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz are explicitly listed and stable.
Query Endpoint Limitations

Unavailable:
Availability of RDF dump (query) = False or ""-""/""No dump available"" (e.g., 2025-07-13, 2025-09-07).
SPARQL or live querying is not supported.
Update Frequency

Monthly Cadence:
Dataset update frequency = ['Monthly'] (2025-07-13), though other entries show ""-"" (missing metadata).
Age of Data:
Age of data = 2011-08-01 (old baseline) with _dataset_update_frequency_specified = 1.0 (defined schedule).

Here's a breakdown:

Key Factors for Availability Score = 1
RDF Dump Availability (Metadata)

Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.000000 on 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03.
Indicates the RDF dump was online and accessible for download.
URIs Dereferenceability (F1-D)

F1-D URIs dereferenceability = 1.000000 on 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03.
All URIs in the dataset were dereferenceable (i.e., resolvable via HTTP).
Metadata Availability (A1-M)

A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources = 1.000000 on 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03.
Metadata was retrievable from functional primary sources (e.g., SPARQL endpoints or data dumps).
Other Perfect Scores

Availability for download (metadata) = 1.000000 (RDF dump downloadable).
SPARQL endpoint = Available (operational endpoint at https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql).
Why It Dropped Later (2025-09-07)
By 2025-09-07, the availability score fell to 0.75 due to degradation in metrics such as:

F1-D URIs dereferenceability = 1.000000 → Remained perfect.
Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.000000 → Still online.
But failures occurred elsewhere (unlisted in the snippet), likely in query/HTTPS support or similar sub-metrics.
Formula (Simplified)
The availability score is a linear combination of sub-metrics like:
Availability Score=w 
1
​
 ⋅RDF Dump Avail.+w 
2
​
 ⋅Deref. Score+…
A score of 1.0 implies all sub-metrics were satisfied at maximum weight ($w_i$) during the period.

Key Factors Contributing to the Availability Score of 1
A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources consistently scores 1.000000 (e.g., on 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03).
This indicates metadata is reliably accessible through DBLP's official interfaces.
Availability of RDF dump (metadata) is confirmed with 1.000000 (e.g., on 2025-07-13, 2025-09-07).
The dataset provides downloadable RDF dumps at:
https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples
https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz.
F1-D URIs dereferenceability achieves 1.000000 (e.g., on 2025-07-13, 2025-09-07).
This means all URIs in the dataset resolve correctly to their intended resources.
The SPARQL endpoint is operational at https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql (listed multiple times).
This contributes to the ""A1-D Working access point(s)"" score of 1.000000.
Important Notes
Score Variability: The availability score later drops to 0.750000 (e.g., on 2025-09-07), likely due to temporary issues like:
Dataset update frequency being unspecified ([] at multiple timestamps).
VoID file absence ([""dblp-kg"",""VoID file absent"",""2025-07-13"",""Availability VoID file""]).
Key Metrics Not Affecting the Score:

- RDF dump (query) availability: False (non-critical for metadata availability).
- Number of triples: 0.0 (only affects completeness, not availability).
- Interlinking completeness: 0.0 (irrelevant to availability).

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for ""Amount of data"" does not necessarily mean the dataset is completely empty. It means the dataset scored minimally (worst case) in the composite metrics for data volume, but some data might still exist (e.g., sparse entities, labels, or other minor elements).

Key Reasons:
Composite Metric Definition:
The ""Amount of data score"" is a linear combination of multiple sub-metrics (e.g., number of triples, entities, properties, labels). A score of 0 indicates poor performance across these metrics, not absolute emptiness.

Possible Partial Data:
A dataset could score 0 if:

Most metrics are missing/zero (e.g., no triples, entities).
One critical metric fails (e.g., missing SPARQL endpoint prevents metric calculation).
Metrics offset each other (e.g., low entity count cancels out a moderate label count).
Examples from Data:

Some entries show 0.000000 for metrics like Number of triples but non-zero values elsewhere (e.g., [""2025-07-13"",""dblp-kg"",""43.214000"",""Normalized score""]).
A dataset with Amount of data score = 0 might still have Number of labels > 0 (e.g., sparsely annotated data).
Metric Design:
The score's range ([0,1]) normalizes performance — 0 = worst, 1 = best. A dataset isn’t required to be empty to score 0, only to perform poorly in the defined metrics.

When Could 0 Imply Emptiness?
Scenario	Example Metrics
✅ All sub-metrics = 0
(e.g., no triples, entities, labels)	Number of triples (metadata) = 0, Number of entities = 0, Labels = 0
❌ Single critical failure
(e.g., missing SPARQL endpoint)	Number of triples linked = - (metric invalid), but other metrics might exist

Conclusion:
To confirm whether a dataset is truly empty, inspect individual metrics like Number of triples, entities, or labels — not just the aggregate score. A score of 0 signals severe insufficiency, not guaranteed emptiness.",1,1,0.5,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the provided dataset quality metrics, an Amount of data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. Here's why:

Key Analysis
Composite Metric:
The ""Amount of data score"" is a linear combination of multiple metrics (e.g., Number of triples, Number of entities, Number of labels/comments).

A score of 0 could mean:
Some (but not all) metrics scored 0, dragging down the average.
Missing data for certain metrics (e.g., unresponsive SPARQL endpoints, unreachable metadata).
Dataset Examples:

dblp-kg has 0.000000 for Number of triples (metadata) on 2025-08-03 but 157,187,352 on 2025-09-07.
CIDOC-CRM reports 0.000000 for Number of triples (metadata) on multiple dates, yet other metrics (Believability score = 0.800) imply data exists.
Metric-Specific Zeroes:

A metric like Number of triples (metadata) may output 0 if:
The dataset lacks metadata-derivable triples (actual data may still exist).
The SPARQL endpoint is unavailable (output: ""-"").
An error occurred (output: ""False"").
In Summary
Scenario	Implications
All metrics = 0	Dataset likely has minimal/no data for measured dimensions (not necessarily all data).
Partial metrics = 0	Could be missing metadata, broken endpoints, or scoring edge cases.
Insufficient data flag	Some metrics explicitly return ""insufficient data"" errors (≠ ""no data"").
Bottom Line
A score of 0 signals critical gaps in measured data dimensions, not absolute emptiness. Always validate with raw metrics (e.g., triples count, entity count) before concluding a dataset is empty.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Based on the provided dataset and metric definitions, the availability score of 1 indicates that both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF data dump are working and accessible. Here's the breakdown:

Key Findings
Metric Definitions:

A1-D Working access point(s):
This metric scores 1 if either the SPARQL endpoint or RDF dump is operational.
However, this is not sufficient alone for an overall availability score of 1.
Availability score:
This is a composite metric derived from availability-related checks (e.g., SPARQL endpoint, RDF dump) and scores 1 only when all critical availability criteria are met.
Dataset Examples:

dblp-kg (2025-08-03):
A1-D = 1 (operational SPARQL endpoint: https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql).
Availability for download (metadata) = 1 (RDF dump online).
Availability score = 1.
✅ Both access points are operational.
LemmaBank (2025-09-07):
A1-D = 1 (SPARQL endpoint accessible).
Availability of RDF dump (query) = - (dump missing).
Availability score = 0.5.
❌ Availability score < 1 due to missing dump.
Failure Cases:
If either the SPARQL endpoint or dump fails:

NoiPA (2025-09-07):
SPARQL endpoint Available, but RDF dump offline → Availability score = 0.5.
Conclusion
An availability score of 1 requires both the SPARQL endpoint and RDF dump to be functional. Partial availability (only one working access point) results in a score of ≤ 0.5.

E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"To determine if an availability score of 1 implies both the SPARQL endpoint and data dump are operational:

Key Metrics Considered:

SPARQL Endpoint Availability: Status can be ""Available"", ""Offline"", or missing.
RDF Dump Availability: Status can be online (True/1), offline (False/0), or missing (-/-1).
A1-D Working Access Point(s): Scores 1 if either SPARQL or dump is operational, 0.5 if one is partially accessible, 0 otherwise.
Analysis of Data Points:

For dblp-kg (2025-08-03), the availability score was 1.000000, with both the SPARQL endpoint marked as ""Available"" and the RDF dump (metadata) scored as 1.000000 (online).
In contrast, datasets like bpr (2025-07-13) had a lower availability score (0.500000) when only the SPARQL endpoint was available, but the RDF dump was offline.
Conclusion:
The availability score aggregates multiple metrics, including SPARQL endpoint and RDF dump status. A score of 1 requires both the SPARQL endpoint and RDF dump to be fully operational, as partial availability results in a lower score.",0.5,0.5,0.5,,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Based on the provided dataset, a license value of ""1"" indicates that either a machine- or human-readable license is retrievable, but it does not explicitly confirm whether the license is an open license. However, an analysis of the dataset reveals:

Key Findings:
Metric R1.1 (Machine- or human-readable license retrievable) explicitly outputs:

1: License exists and is retrievable.
0: License not found.
Correlation with Open Licenses:

When R1.1 = 1, the associated licenses in the dataset are all open licenses:
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero (CC0)
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 (Apache 2.0)

No closed/proprietary licenses appear in the dataset when R1.1 = 1.
Conclusion:
While license = 1 does not universally guarantee an open license, in this specific dataset:

All cases where R1.1 = 1 correspond to explicitly open licenses.

Notes:
License detection methods: The _machine_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable and _human_readable_license_query_is_retrievable metrics validate license presence but not openness.
Open license identification: Requires explicit checks of the license URL/content against known open licenses (e.g., SPDX identifiers).
Exception handling: A value of 1 paired with False in License machine redeable (metadata) indicates non-open licenses (e.g., [""False"", ""CIDOC-CRM"", ""License machine redeable (metadata)"", ""2025-07-13""]).
Final Answer:
Yes, in this dataset, a license set to 1 implies an open license is used, but rigorously validating openness requires inspecting the license URL/terms directly.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,

Key Findings:

License Retrieval Metric:

The parameter R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source defines:
Output: 1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise
Dimension: FAIR
(This metric only verifies whether any license is retrievable, not whether it is open).
Open License Confirmation:

A license = 1 does not guarantee an open license—it only confirms the presence of a retrievable license (which could be proprietary, restrictive, or open).
To confirm if a license is open, you must inspect the specific license URI (e.g., http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero is open, while a custom/proprietary URL may not be).

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"Based on the provided dataset and the definitions of the verifiability metrics, if the Verifiability score is set to 1, it means that all underlying verifiability-related provider information is complete and verified. Here's why:

Key Verifiability Metrics
Sources: Indicates whether authors, contributors, publishers, and data sources are stated in metadata.
Output: string if present; False if absent.
Author (metadata) & Author (query): Checks if authors are indicated in metadata or retrievable via SPARQL.
Publisher: Verifies if publisher details are retrievable.
Contributor: Checks if contributor information is present.
Signed: Confirms whether the dataset is cryptographically signed (a trust marker).
Verifiability Score Calculation
The Verifiability score is a linear combination of these individual metrics. A score of 1 implies that:

All provider information (authors, publishers, contributors, sources) is explicitly stated.
The dataset is signed (if applicable).
No critical information is missing (False/[]/- outputs).
Evidence from the Dataset
No entry has a Verifiability score of 1.000000 (the highest seen is 0.498333 for NoiPA).
Examples of incomplete provider information:
[""False"", ""Is on a trusted provider list"", ""2025-09-07"", ""LemmaBank""] (believability metric, but related).
[""CIDOC-CRM"", ""Author (metadata)"", ""2025-07-13"", ""Name: absent. email: absent""].
Conclusion
Verifiability = 1 means all provider information is fully set (no missing/wrong values).
In practice, achieving 1 requires all underlying verifiability metrics to return optimal values (e.g., non-empty strings, no False/[]).

E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean all provider information is available. Here's why:

Verifiability Score Definition:

The verifiability score is a composite metric derived from multiple verifiability sub-metrics (e.g., presence of sources, dataset signing, metadata completeness). It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is optimal.
It measures the ability to verify the dataset's origins and metadata, not the completeness of provider-specific information like trustworthiness or identity.
Provider Information ≠ Verifiability:

Provider trustworthiness (e.g., Is on a trusted provider list) is part of the believability dimension, not verifiability.
Metrics like Author, Contributor, or Publisher availability are included in verifiability, but a perfect verifiability score could still be achieved if other verifiability metrics compensate (e.g., signed metadata, retrievable licenses).
Data Observations:

Datasets like NoiPA achieve a verifiability score of 0.498 (non-maximal) despite missing author names (Author (metadata): Name: absent).
Even datasets with Verifiability score: 1 (if observed) might lack some provider details if other verifiability metrics (e.g., Signed: True) outweigh gaps.
Key Distinction:
Metric        Dimension        Impact on Verifiability Score
Sources availability        Verifiability        Direct
Signed dataset        Verifiability        Direct
Provider trustworthiness        Believability        None
Author/Publisher info        Verifiability        Partial (weighted)
Conclusion:
A verifiability score of 1 signifies excellent metadata verifiability but does not guarantee all provider-related details are present. For full provider transparency, additional metrics like Believability score or specific provider checks must be examined.",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,
