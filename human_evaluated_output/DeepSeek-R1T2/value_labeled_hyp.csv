Key Findings
Minimal Variation:

Scores range between 0.999660 and 0.999700, differing only in the fifth decimal place.
The maximum observed deviation is 0.000040, which is statistically insignificant for most practical purposes.
Consistency Over Time:

From May to September 2025, the score stabilizes at 0.999660 after a single negligible fluctuation in May.
Compared to other dimensions (e.g., consistency score fixed at 0.400000), accuracy shows even less variability.
Contextual Stability:

Metrics like verifiability (0.498333) and believability (0.800000) are also constant, suggesting systemic stability in NoiPA's data quality framework.
Conclusion
The accuracy of NoiPA is functionally constant over the observed period. Minor deviations are likely due to measurement rounding or transient factors, not indicative of a meaningful trend. For purposes of reliability assessment, NoiPA's accuracy can be considered stable.

E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The DBLP dataset consistently achieves an availability score of 1.000000 (e.g., on 2025-08-03 and 2025-07-13) due to multiple reliable access mechanisms meeting core FAIR principles for data availability. Below is the breakdown:

🟢 Core Reasons for Availability Score = 1:
Functional SPARQL Endpoint:


{""Available"":[""dblp-kg"",""Sparql endpoint"",""2025-08-03""]}
SPARQL endpoint https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql is consistently available for querying.
Downloadable Metadata:


{""1.000000"":[""dblp-kg"",""Availability for download (metadata)"",""2025-08-03""]}
Metadata is always retrievable via primary sources.
Direct Dataset Downloads:


{""['https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples', 'https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz']"":[""dblp-kg"",""URL for download the dataset"",""2025-08-03""]}
Persistent URLs provide RDF dumps (NTriples/Turtle formats).
No Authentication Required:


{""False"":[""dblp-kg"",""Requires authentication"",""2025-08-03""]}
Open access without sign-in barriers.
🔍 Scores Underpinning Availability:
Metric	Value	Impact on Availability
A1-M Metadata Availability	1.000000	Metadata retrievable via working primary sources (e.g., dblp.org)
A1-D Working Access Points	1.000000	Operational SPARQL endpoint + accessible RDF dumps.
Availability of RDF Dump (Metadata)	1.000000	Ensures metadata is structured and downloadable.
Machine-Readable License (Metadata)	1.000000	License (CC-Zero) is explicitly retrievable.
HTTPS Compliance (A1.2)	1.000000	Secure https://dblp.org supports accessibility.
F1-D URI Dereferenceability	1.000000	Dataset's URIs resolve correctly (essential for linked data).
Caveats/Observations:
Downgraded Availability Scores:

Score dropped to 0.750000 on 2025-09-07 (reason: likely transient service issues).
No VoID File:


{""VoID file absent"":[""dblp-kg"",""Availability VoID file"",""2025-08-03""]}
Missing VoID file slightly impacts metadata richness but not core availability scoring.
Schema Reuse:


{""1.000000"":[""dblp-kg"",""_reuse_of_existing_vocabularies"",""2025-08-03""]}
DBLP reuses standard vocabularies, enhancing interoperability.
Formal Calculation:
The availability score (A1-D) is a weighted aggregation of:

A1-D= 
⎩
⎨
⎧
​
  
1
0.5
0
​
  
if SPARQL/RDF dump operational
if partially available
otherwise
​
 
DBLP satisfies the 1 threshold due to SPARQL + RDF dump accessibility, ensuring maximal availability.

Conclusion: DBLP's high availability stems from multiple redundant access methods (SPARQL + downloads), HTTPS, and metadata stability—aligning with FAIR principles.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Answer: No, a score of 0 for ""Amount of data"" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty.
Key Explanation:
Score Definition:
The ""Amount of data score"" is calculated as a linear combination of multiple metrics (e.g., Number of triples, Number of blank nodes, Number of entities).
Its description states:


""Amount of data score"": {
  ""description"": ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension [...]"",
  ""input"": ""Amount of data metrics scores"",
  ""output"": ""[0,1]. Best value: 1.""
}
Possible Reasons for a Score of 0:

One or more critical metrics (e.g., Number of triples) returned invalid results (e.g., null, None, or an error).
Example:
{""None"":[""bpr"",""Number of triples (query)"",""2025-05-04""]}
All aggregated metrics scored extremely low (e.g., close to 0).
Dataset availability issues (e.g., SPARQL endpoint offline during scoring).
Evidence from the Data:

No dataset in your input has ""Amount of data score"": ""0.000000"".
Counterexample: Even datasets with known issues (e.g., micro-coronavirus with 0.666667 for ""Amount of data"") are not empty but have problems (e.g., ""No dump available"" for Availability of a common accepted Media Type).
Metric Dependency:
A score of 0 might reflect missing metadata (e.g., Void/DCAT descriptions) rather than zero triples. For example:


{""None"":[""bpr"",""Number of triples (query)"",""2025-05-04""]}
This means the triple count couldn’t be calculated, not that it’s zero.

Dataset Content:
Some datasets with low ""Amount of data"" scores (e.g., ""0.333333"" for CIDOC-CRM) still have:


{""0.333333"":[""CIDOC-CRM"",""Amount of data score"",""2025-05-04""]}
{""353740827.000000"":[""bpr"",""Number of triples (query)"",""2025-08-03""]}  # Non-zero but scored low
Practical Takeaways:
Investigate Metrics: Check individual metrics like Number of triples (query) and Number of entities to confirm emptiness.
Verify Availability: A score of 0 could indicate inaccessibility (e.g., SPARQL endpoint down) rather than emptiness.
Context Matters: Low scores may reflect schema issues (e.g., invalid counts) rather than actual data absence.
Conclusion: A score of 0 signals severe issues in the ""Amount of data"" dimension but requires deeper inspection to determine if the dataset is truly empty or just poorly measured.

Empty Dataset⇏Amount of Data Score=0(but the converse might hold)",0.5,0,0.5,blank nodes mentioned,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.

Key Reasoning:
Score Definition:
The amount-of-data score is a linear combination of multiple metrics (e.g., number of triples, entities, labels/comments) with an output range of [0,1]. A score of 0 indicates poor performance in these metrics but does not guarantee an absence of data.

Evidence from Data:

Datasets like NoiPA and micro-coronavirus have non-zero amount-of-data scores (0.666667, 0.333333) but still show 0.000000 in completeness scores.
Entries like {""None"":[""bpr"",""Number of triples (query)"",""2025-05-04""]} suggest missing metrics (not necessarily zero data).
Metric Distinction:
Low scores arise from factors like sparse annotations, poor metadata, or computational errors—not just missing data. For example:

dblp-kg has 140967973.000000 labels/comments despite a 0.000000 completeness score.
Empty fields (e.g., None) indicate unmeasurable metrics, not confirmed emptiness.
Conclusion:
A score of 0 reflects low-quality or unmeasured data dimensions, not an empty dataset.

Key Metrics Defining the Amount-of-Data Score:
Number of triples (query):
Integer or ""None"" (if unmeasurable)
Number of labels/comments present:
Count of rdfs:label/rdfs:comment usage
Percentage of triples with labels:
Total triples
Labelled triples
​
 
Examples from Your Data:
Dataset	Amount-of-Data Score	Key Metric Value
NoiPA	0.666667	Number of triples (query) = 446,170,057
dblp-kg	0.333333	Labels/comments = 140,967,973
micro-coronavirus	0.666667	Number of blank nodes = 8,453,996
Edge Cases:
bpr shows {""None"":[""bpr"",""Number of triples (query)"",""2025-05-04""]} → Metric not measured.
w3c-wordnet has {""0.000000"":[""w3c-wordnet"",""Completeness score"",""2025-05-04""]} yet Number of triples (metadata) = 710000.",0.5,0,0.5,,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"To determine whether an availability score of 1 means both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are operational, we need to analyze the provided data and metric definitions:

Key Metrics Analysis
Availability Score Definition

{""Availability score"": {..., ""output"": ""[0,1]. Best value: 1.""}}
This indicates that 1 is the highest achievable score for availability.
Access Points Metric (A1-D)


{""A1-D Working access point(s)"": {
    ""output"": ""1: operational SPARQL or accessible data dump; 
               0.5: accessible SPARQL endpoint or data dump; 
               0: otherwise""
}}
A score of 1 requires at least one operational access point (SPARQL endpoint or data dump).
A score of 0.5 represents partial functionality.
SPARQL Endpoint Status


{""Sparql endpoint"": {
    ""output"": ""Offline | Available | - (missing)""
}}
RDF Dump Status


{""Availability of RDF dump (query)"": {
    ""output"": ""False (offline) | True (online) | - (missing)""
}}
Critical Findings from Data
Case Study: dblp-kg (2025-09-07)


""1.000000"": [""dblp-kg"", ""Availability score"", ""2025-09-07""]
""Available"": [""dblp-kg"", ""Sparql endpoint"", ""2025-09-07""]
""False"": [""dblp-kg"", ""Availability of RDF dump (query)"", ""2025-09-07""]
Availability Score = 1
SPARQL endpoint is Available, but RDF dump is offline.
This proves 1 doesn't require both to be operational.
Conclusion
Supporting Evidence
Dataset	Date	Availability Score	SPARQL Status	RDF Dump Status	A1-D Score

Key Insight: Datasets like dblp-kg achieve an availability score of 1.0 with only one working access point (SPARQL endpoint).
The score is calculated as a weighted combination of metrics, where A1-D is a primary contributor.",0,0,0,numer of labels mentioned,0,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"No, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are fully operational. It indicates at least one working access point (SPARQL endpoint or data dump) is available, meeting the minimum criteria for maximum scoring.

Detailed Explanation
Key Availability Metrics
A1-D Working Access Point(s)

Output:
1: Operational SPARQL or accessible data dump
0.5: Partially accessible SPARQL/data dump
0: No operational access point
This is the primary determinant of the availability score and follows an OR logic (either endpoint suffices for full credit).
Sparql Endpoint Status

Returns Available (operational), Offline, or - (missing).
Independent of the data dump's status.
Availability of RDF Dump

Checks whether the dump is online (True), offline (False), or missing (-).
Independent of the SPARQL endpoint status.
Availability Score Calculation
The overall Availability score (0–1) is a combination of metrics like:

A1-D Working access point(s)
Sparql endpoint status
Availability of RDF dump
Other secondary metrics.
Example:


# Simplified scoring logic  
if SPARQL_online or RDF_dump_online:    # Either working
    A1D_score = 1.0  
else:                                   # No access point
    A1D_score = 0.0  
 
availability_score = 0.7 * A1D_score + 0.3 * (other_metrics...)
A score of 1 implies full points for A1-D and strong performance in other metrics, but not necessarily both endpoints being operational.

Evidence from Data
Dataset	Availability Score	SPARQL Status	RDF Dump Status	A1-D Score
w3c-wordnet (2025-05-04)	0.500000	- (missing)	True	1.000000
dblp-kg (2025-05-04)	0.975000	Available	False	1.000000
bpr (2025-09-07)	1.000000	Available	False	1.0
When the Availability score = 1, only one access point is operational (e.g., SPARQL or dump).
The score rewards either functional endpoint, not both.
Conclusion
An availability score of 1 indicates strong accessibility through at least one reliable method, not necessarily both. For robust redundancy, check individual SPARQL/dump metrics explicitly.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Based on the provided metadata, here's the answer to your question:

Conclusion:

A license score of 1 means that a license is explicitly reported and retrievable for the dataset (in either human- or machine-readable form).
However, this does not guarantee the license is open/free, as the value only checks existence and retrievability, not licensing terms. To confirm openness, you must inspect the actual license URL(s).
Key Evidence from Metadata
Metric Definition (for R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source):


""R1.1 ..."": {
    ""output"": ""1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"",
    ""dimension"": ""FAIR""
}
A score of 1 solely indicates a license is present and retrievable.
Licenses Used (examples):

Open licenses appear in retrievable licenses (e.g., cc-by-sa, cc-zero, cc-by):

""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa"": [""bpr"", ""License...""],
""https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"": [""dblp-kg"", ""License...""]
Some datasets show non-open licenses (e.g., proprietary):

""https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"": [""w3c-wordnet"", ""License...""]
Licensing Scores:

Scores like Licensing score: 0.500000 typically reflect presence of a license, not its openness.
Practical Implication
In the given data, most datasets with score 1 use open licenses (e.g., CC licenses), but this is not guaranteed universally.
Always verify the specific license URL to confirm openness traits (e.g., reuse permissions, attribution requirements).
The FAIR principles (embedded in this metadata) focus on discoverability, not licensing terms:

1 = License metadata exists and is findable.
Openness requires checking compliance with definitions like OSI or OKD.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Based on the provided dataset metadata, the answer is no - a license score of 1 does not inherently indicate the use of an open license. Here's the breakdown:

Core Analysis
licensing=1 Definition
The metadata defines the metric ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" as:

Output: 1 = license explicitly reported, 0 = otherwise
This only confirms metadata presence, not license type (open/proprietary).
Licensing Examples in Data

Open licenses are explicitly specified via URLs (e.g.):

""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa"": [""bpr"", ...]
""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.it"": [""bpr"", ...]
""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by"": [""micro-coronavirus"", ...]
Non-open licenses aren't present in this dataset, but the structure allows any URL.
Licensing Score Logic
The ""Licensing score"" is computed as a weighted value (e.g., 0.500000 for ""bpr"" in multiple entries). A value of 1 would require full compliance across all licensing metadata metrics (retrievability, format, etc.), not open licensing validation.

Metric Specification:


{""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"": {
  ""description"": ""Any license retrievable"",
  ""input"": ""(Meta)data"",
  ""output"": ""1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"",
  ""dimension"": ""FAIR""
}}
License URLs != Openness Guarantee
URLs like ""http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence"" (used by UK government) appear with licensing=1, but openness must be verified externally.

Conclusion
License = 1 ➜ ""License metadata is retrievable.""
Openness? Requires checking the actual license URL (e.g., CC-BY, MIT, proprietary).
Automated tools should cross-reference license URLs with known open repositories (e.g., SPDX) for confirmation.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"When the Verifiability score is set to 1 (maximum), it indicates that all verifiability-related metrics for the provider are fully satisfied, meaning all required provider information (e.g., author, publisher, sources, trusted status) is explicitly provided and verifiable. However, no provider in your dataset achieves a Verifiability score of 1, suggesting incomplete information in current records.

Key Details
Verifiability Score Definition:

Computed as a linear combination of verifiability metrics (e.g., Is on a trusted provider list, Sources, Author, Publisher).
Output: [0, 1], where 1 = best possible score.
Critical Verifiability Metrics:

Is on a trusted provider list (Boolean): Indicates trustworthiness.
Sources, Author, Publisher (String/Boolean): Metadata completeness.
Dataset URL, Signed (Boolean): Data accessibility/authenticity.
(See appendix for full metrics).
Analysis of Your Data:

Highest Verifiability Score: 0.498333 (provider: NoiPA).
Trusted Providers ≠ High Verifiability:
Example: environment-agency-bathing-water-quality (trusted) scores only 0.165000.
Metrics like Author (metadata), Publisher frequently return False or [] (empty).
Conclusion
Verifiability = 1: Would imply all provider-related information is complete.
Current State: No provider achieves this, indicating gaps (e.g., missing authors, unsigned datasets, untrusted sources).
Metric	Description	Dimension	Example Values in Data
Is on a trusted provider list	Checks if provider is in a trusted list.	Believability	False (common)
Sources	Declares data sources (author/publisher/website).	Verifiability	False (common)
Author (metadata)	Author name/email in VoID/metadata.	Verifiability	False (common)
Publisher	Publisher info in SPARQL endpoint/VoID.	Verifiability	[] (empty)
Dataset URL	URL for dataset accessibility.	Believability	absent (bpr)
Signed	Whether the dataset is digitally signed.	Verifiability	False (common)
Verifiability score	Aggregated score of all verifiability metrics.	Verifiability	0.11 (bpr)",1,0.5,0.5,not a direct answer,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"A Verifiability score of 1 means the dataset achieves the best possible score for all aggregated verifiability metrics, implying that all provider-related information (author, publisher, sources, etc.) is fully available and verified. However, in the provided metadata, no dataset achieves this perfect score, indicating gaps in at least one verifiability component.

Key Points:
Verifiability Score Definition:

Range: [0, 1], where 1 is optimal.
Computed as a linear combination of individual verifiability metrics (e.g., Sources, Author, Publisher).
Verifiability Metrics:

Sources: Indicates authorship, contributors, publishers, and primary sources.
Author (query): Checks if authors are stated via SPARQL endpoint.
Publisher: Verifies publisher information availability.
Contributor: Identifies contributor details.
Signed: Checks for dataset signatures (cryptographic trust).
Practical Observations:

The highest Verifiability score in the dataset is 0.498333 (NoiPA).
All datasets have incomplete metrics (e.g., False for Is on a trusted provider list).
Conclusion:
If a Verifiability score = 1, all provider metadata must be complete across all verifiability metrics. In reality, no dataset in this snapshot achieves perfection due to missing information.
