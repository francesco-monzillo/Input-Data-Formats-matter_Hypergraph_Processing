📌 Key Accuracy-Related Metrics:
Metric	Value	Comment
Accuracy score	0.000000	Extremely low across all dates (2025-05-04 to 2025-09-07)
F score	0.610-0.80	Moderate inconsistency (ranges from poor to fair)
Verifiability score	0.331667	Low but stable across dates
Completeness score	0.000000	Severely deficient
Representational-Consistency	0.000000	No schema/structural consistency
🔍 Detailed Breakdown:
Core Accuracy Issues:

Not a single non-zero accuracy score in the dataset.
Linked to 0% completeness (Number of entities = None), indicating major data gaps.
Interoperability & Reliability:

Believability: 0.800000 (Surprisingly high despite accuracy issues)
FAIR Score: Ranges from 3.110 to 3.300 (below average for semantic resources)
Reusability: _reuse_of_existing_terms = 1.000000 (good vocabulary alignment)
Critical Weaknesses:

Undefined properties used without declaration: None (no undefined properties)
Uses RDF structures: - (ambiguous implementation status)
Interpretability score: 0.000000 (human readability compromised)
📉 Performance Summary:

    ""FAIR"": 3.3/10.0        # ~33% of theoretical max (assumed 10-point scale)
}
⚠️ Key Observations:
The 2025 timestamps suggest this is future-projected metadata (possibly synthetic/test data).
WordNet's RDF conversion appears to struggle with:
Structural completeness (Number of triples linked = 0.000000)
Semantic precision (Consistency score = 0.000000)
Theoretical strengths in vocabulary reuse (_reuse_of_existing_vocabularies = 1.0) don't translate to practical accuracy.
💡 Recommendations:
Verify Data Currency: The future-dated scores may indicate incomplete/placeholder metrics.
Complement with Original WordNet: The low scores likely reflect issues in the RDF conversion (not Princeton WordNet itself).
Check Scoring Methodology: A 0.000000 accuracy score suggests either catastrophic failure or undefined metrics.

2025-09-07	446,170,057	▲ +6.37M
Key Observations:
Dynamic Dataset:
The triple count increases monotonically over time, suggesting regular updates or data additions:

+34.28M triples added between May 4 and September 7 (446.17M−412.89M).
Average growth rate: ~8.57M triples per month.
Metadata vs. Query Values:
While the ""Number of triples (metadata)"" remains static at 340,000,000 (likely a fixed claim), the actual query results are higher and variable, indicating discrepancies between advertised and real-time data.

Consistent Growth Pattern:
The dataset exhibits no deletions or drops, implying archival/versioned updates rather than dynamic revisions.

Why Does This Matter?
Freshness: The SPARQL endpoint reflects live changes, critical for real-time applications.
Transparency: Metadata claims (340M triples) don’t match queried values, risking misinterpretation.
Reliability Monitoring: Tools relying on stable triple counts should implement versioning checks.
SPARQL Endpoint Stability:
The endpoint URL (https://sparql-noipa.mef.gov.it/sparql) remains unchanged, so fluctuations originate from data updates, not endpoint migrations.

Data Provenance:
No RDF dumps are available (""Availability of RDF dump (query)"": ""False""), making the SPARQL endpoint the sole access point.

Update Frequency:
Metadata indicates annual validation (""Dataset update frequency"": ""http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/frequency/ANNUAL""), but the query-pattern suggests more frequent updates.

Conclusion: The triple count is not static—it evolves with data updates. Users should regularly re-query the endpoint for accurate results.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_1,The number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint is constant?,"No, they slightly increase over time.","Based on the provided data, the number of triples retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint for NoiPA is NOT constant. The values vary across different dates:

E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The DBLP knowledge graph achieves an Availability score of 1.000 due to these key factors, as outlined in your dataset:

🔑 Core Factors for Availability Score 1
Metadata Availability:

A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources = 1.000
Metadata remains consistently accessible via all primary sources (e.g., DBLP website, DOI links).
SPARQL Endpoint:

Sparql endpoint = ""Available""
A live endpoint (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql) ensures real-time programmatic access.
RDF Dump Downloads:

Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.000
Metadata dumps are provided at stable URLs like:

https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples
https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz
FAIR Compliance:

F3-M Data referrable via a DOI = 1.000
Persistent identifiers (DOIs) guarantee long-term resolvability.
F1-D URIs dereferenceability = 1.000 (on most dates)
URIs reliably resolve to machine-readable content.
🤔 Compensating for Lower Sub-Scores
Despite some sub-optimal metrics:

Availability for download (query) = False
Query-based downloads might be restricted, but the SPARQL endpoint availability compensates.
Availability VoID file = ""VoID file absent""
Metadata completeness (A1-M = 1.0) offsets the lack of VoID descriptors.

⚠️ Temporal Variations
Note the score fluctuates slightly over time (e.g., 0.975 on 2025-05-04), likely due to:

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for the Amount of data dimension does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty. Here's the reasoning based on the metadata:

Score Definition
The ""Amount of data score"" is defined as:


{
   ""description"": ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"",
   ""output"": ""[0,1]. Best value: 1."",
   ""dimension"": ""Amount of data""
}
It aggregates multiple metrics like Number of triples, Number of entities, etc.

Why 0 ≠ Empty

A score of 0 indicates missing or failed measurements (e.g., SPARQL endpoint offline, parsing errors) for all constituent metrics.
Example metrics (with outputs):
Number of triples (query): integer or ""-"" for missing endpoint
Number of entities: integer or ""-"" for unretrievable data
If these metrics fail to execute, they contribute 0 to the composite score, regardless of actual data volume.
Validation Mechanism
To confirm dataset emptiness, check raw counts (not the composite score):

Actual empty dataset:
Number of triples = 0 (e.g., if triples exist but all other metrics fail, the score would still be >0).
Measurement failure:
Metrics return - or errors (e.g., output: ""None"" for Number of triples).
Key Observations from Data
w3c-wordnet Example:
""Number of triples (query)"": ""None"" → ""Amount of data score"": 0.333333 (partial failure, not 0).
Datasets with a score of 0 (e.g., environment-agency-bathing-water-quality on 2025-08-03) imply all underlying metrics failed, not confirmed emptiness.
Conclusion
Score = 0 ⇒ measurement failure, not confirmed dataset emptiness.
Dataset emptiness requires explicit Number of triples = 0 validation.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, an Amount of data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. Instead, it indicates that the dataset scored poorly on the specified metrics for data quantity (e.g., triple count, entity count, or metadata completeness), not that it has zero triples or files. Here's the breakdown:

Key Points from the Data
Score Definition:

The ""Amount of data score"" is computed as a linear combination of individual metrics (e.g., number of triples, entities, or labels).
Its range is [0,1], where 1 is the best possible value.
Input: Metrics like Number of triples (query), Number of entities, etc.
Output: A normalized score reflecting performance against these metrics.
Example Cases:

dblp-kg has an Amount of data score of 0.333333 but lists:
""Number of triples (query)"": 1,335,106,894.000000 (1.3B triples).
bpr has a score of 0.666667 with:
""Number of triples (query)"": 353,740,827.000000 (354M triples).
Even datasets with a score of 0.000000 (e.g., dblp-kg in some entries) still contain data (e.g., blank nodes, labels).
Why Scores Can Be Low:

A score of 0 suggests failure to meet specific criteria (e.g., missing metadata, incomplete annotations, or invalid structure), not necessarily an empty dataset.
Metrics like Presence of example, Percentage of triples with labels, or Vocabularies impact the score.
Conclusion
A score of 0 reflects poor compliance with the defined ""amount of data"" metrics, not an absence of data. Check the individual metrics (e.g., Number of triples, Number of entities) to confirm actual data presence.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"No, an Availability Score of 1 does not necessarily mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.

Reasoning:
Composite Score:
The Availability Score is computed as a linear combination of multiple availability-related metrics, not just SPARQL endpoint or RDF dump status. Key metrics include:

A1-D Working access point(s):
Outputs 1 if either a SPARQL endpoint or a data dump is operational.
Outputs 0.5 if only one is partially accessible, and 0 if neither works.
Sparql endpoint: Checks if the SPARQL endpoint is online (Available/Offline).
Availability of RDF dump: Checks if the data dump is downloadable (True/False/1.000000/-).
Independent Contributions:
A score of 1 can be achieved even if only one access point is fully operational. For example:

If the SPARQL endpoint is online (e.g., dblp-kg dataset: ""Sparql endpoint"": ""Available"") but the RDF dump is offline (""Availability of RDF dump (query)"": ""False""), the overall availability score can still approach 1 due to other contributing factors.
Conversely, an online RDF dump with an offline SPARQL endpoint might also achieve a high score.
Evidence from Data:

The w3c-wordnet dataset has an Availability Score of 0.5 despite A1-D = 1.000000 (full access point operationality) because other metrics (e.g., VoID file absence) reduce the score.
The dblp-kg dataset has an Availability Score of 1.000000 with a working SPARQL endpoint (Available) and an RDF dump marked as False in queries but 1.000000 in metadata.
Conclusion:
An Availability Score of 1 indicates robust accessibility overall, but not necessarily both the SPARQL endpoint and data dump working simultaneously. The score aggregates multiple factors, where partial functionality (e.g., one access point) can still yield a high score.

Key Availability Metrics:
Metric	Description	Output
A1-D Working access point(s)	1 if SPARQL or dump works; 0.5 if partially accessible.	1/0.5/0
Sparql endpoint	Checks SPARQL endpoint status.	Available/Offline/-
Availability of RDF dump (query)	Checks RDF dump downloadability.	True/False/-

E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean both the SPARQL endpoint and data dump are operational. Here's why:

Key Metrics & Definitions
A1-D Working access point(s):
Outputs 1 if there is either:

An operational SPARQL endpoint, or
An accessible RDF data dump.
(Score = 1 if at least one access point works)
Availability score:
The overall score (Availability score) is weighted across multiple metrics, where A1-D is a critical component. A score of 1 indicates optimal performance across all evaluated availability metrics, but this does not require both endpoints to be operational.

Example Case
Dataset dblp-kg (2025-08-03):
Availability score = 1.000000
SPARQL endpoint: Available
RDF dump (metadata): 1 (online)
RDF dump (query): False (offline)
Here, the score is 1 despite the RDF dump being offline because:

The SPARQL endpoint is functional (Available).
Metadata confirms availability of the RDF dump (1).
When Does the Score Require Both?
The score does not inherently require both endpoints to be up. It prioritizes redundancy—either a working SPARQL endpoint or accessible data dump suffices for partial credit (up to a full score, depending on other metrics).

Threshold Breakdown
Score	Meaning
1	Ideal: Both endpoints operational, or metadata confirms availability even if one is down (e.g., SPARQL up + dump verified via metadata).
0.5	Partial: Only one access point works (e.g., SPARQL up but dump missing/offline).
0	Failure: No functional access points.
Conclusion
An availability score of 1 does not strictly require both endpoints to be operational. It reflects the best-case scenario of the dataset's accessibility, which may include one working access point + metadata confirmation of backups.

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","In the provided dataset, if the license status is set to 1 for metrics like _machine_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable or R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source, it does not inherently guarantee an open license is used. Instead, it indicates that a license (of any type) is explicitly reported and retrievable. However, in this specific dataset, all retrievable licenses referenced (e.g., CC-BY, CC-Zero, Apache 2.0) are open licenses.

Key Observations:
Metric semantics:

Metrics like R1.1 output 1 if a license exists and is retrievable, regardless of license type (open or proprietary).
Example entry:

Key Findings
When the license metric is set to 1, it does not inherently guarantee an open license but indicates that a license (machine- or human-readable) is explicitly declared and retrievable. All licenses observed in this dataset with a score of 1 happen to be open licenses, though the scoring system itself doesn't enforce this requirement.

Detailed Analysis
1. Licensing Score Definition
Metric: R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source
Output: 1 if a license is explicitly reported; 0 otherwise.
Dimension: FAIR (Focuses on retrievability, not openness).
2. Licenses Observed in the Data
License URL	Type	Open License?
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0	Apache 2.0	✅ Yes
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero	CC Zero	✅ Yes
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/	CC BY 4.0	✅ Yes
https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/	CC Zero	✅ Yes
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.1/jp/	CC BY 2.1 JP	✅ Yes
All licenses in the dataset are open licenses, but the scoring system would also give 1 for non-open licenses if they were declared.

3. Key Distinction
A score of 1 means:
∃L:Licence L is retrievable
but does not imply:
L∈OpenLicenses
Example: A proprietary license would still score 1 if properly declared.
Summary
If license = 1: Indicates the dataset has a retrievable license (machine/human-readable).
In this dataset: All licenses with 1 are open licenses.
General rule: Always verify the specific license URL even when the score is 1.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"A Verifiability score of 1 indicates that all individual metrics contributing to the verifiability dimension are fully satisfied, including provider-related information. Here’s the breakdown:

Verifiability Definition:

The Verifiability score is computed as a linear combination of metrics under the ""Verifiability"" dimension. A score of 1 is the best possible value, requiring all sub-metrics to achieve their optimal values.
Key Provider-Related Metrics:

Trusted Provider List: True if the provider is trusted.
Author/Publisher/Sources: Must explicitly state authors, contributors, or data sources.
Licensing: Machine/human-readable licenses must be retrievable (e.g., True or a valid URL).
Metadata Completeness: Includes dataset URL, modification dates, and update frequency.
Other metrics like Signed, Presence of Example, and dataset history.
Analysis:

None of the datasets in the provided JSON achieve a Verifiability score of 1 (e.g., CIDOC-CRM scores 0.3317, NoiPA scores 0.4983).
Lower scores correlate with missing provider details (e.g., Author (metadata)=""Name: absent. email: absent"").
For a score of 1, all metrics must be True or fully specified.
Yes—a Verifiability score of 1 means all provider-related information is fully set and validated. Absence of any critical data point lowers the score below 1.

E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"Based on the provided data and definitions, the answer is no. A Verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean all provider information is available. Here’s the detailed reasoning:

Key Analysis
Verifiability Score Definition:

Description: ""Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores"".
Output: [0,1], where 1 is the best value.
Metrics Involved: Metrics under the Verifiability dimension (e.g., Sources, Author (query), Publisher, Contributor, Signed).
Provider Information Metrics:

Sources: Checks for authors, contributors, publishers, and sources in metadata.
Author (query)/Author (metadata): Checks for author availability via SPARQL or VoID.
Publisher/Contributor: Similar checks for publisher/contributor details.
These are individual metrics contributing to the overall Verifiability score.
Critical Insight:

The Verifiability score is a weighted combination of multiple metrics (not all provider-related).
Even if provider-specific metrics like Publisher scored 1, other metrics (e.g., Signed) could lower the overall score if they underperform.
Conversely, a perfect Verifiability score (1) does not explicitly require all provider information components to be perfect. Other metrics (e.g., dataset signing) could compensate for missing provider details in the overall calculation.
Example from Data
CIDOC-CRM: Verifiability score = 0.331667, with Author (query) = - (missing) and Publisher = - (missing).
NoiPA: Verifiability score = 0.498333, but Author (metadata) is partial (name missing, email present).
No dataset in the sample achieves Verifiability score = 1, reinforcing that missing provider information restricts maximum scoring.

Final Conclusion
A Verifiability score of 1 indicates optimal performance across all verifiability metrics, but not necessarily completeness of all provider information. Provider-specific metrics like Author/Publisher are contributors to the score, not absolute prerequisites.
