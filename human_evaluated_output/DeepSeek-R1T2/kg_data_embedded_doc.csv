This consistent score indicates that accuracy-related quality metrics for this dataset are not met or remain unchanged during this period.

Summary of Accuracy Scores Over Time:
Measurement Date	Accuracy Score	Dataset
2025-05-04	0.0	w3c-wordnet
2025-06-01	0.0	w3c-wordnet

2025-08-03	0.0	w3c-wordnet
2025-09-07	0.0	w3c-wordnet
Explanation:
The metric URI for accuracy is <http://example.org/Quality-Metric/Accuracy%20score>.
All measurements for w3c-wordnet under this metric return dqv:value ""0.0"".
Other datasets (e.g., LemmaBank, NoiPA) show different accuracy values, but the question specifically pertains to w3c-wordnet.

IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"Based on the provided RDF quality measurements for WordNet (specifically the W3C conversion of Princeton WordNet to RDF), here is an analysis of its accuracy metrics and related quality indicators:

Key Observations on Accuracy Metrics
Explicit Accuracy Score 🎯
All measurements of Accuracy score are 0.0 across all timestamps (2025-05-04 to 2025-09-07):


<.../w3c-wordnet/2025-07-13/Accuracy%20score>  dqv:value ""0.0"";
<.../w3c-wordnet/2025-09-07/Accuracy%20score>  dqv:value ""0.0"";
<.../w3c-wordnet/2025-05-04/Accuracy%20score>  dqv:value ""0.0"";
This suggests that the measured accuracy metric (likely related to correctness of facts) is consistently reported as zero.

Related Metrics 🔄

F-score: Ranges from 0.61 to 0.8 (higher is better), indicating reasonable precision/recall in tasks like lexical semantics.
A-score: Stable at 0.75 (max 1.0), reflecting reliability/authoritativeness.
I-score: 0.75 across all timestamps (interlinking completeness).
FAIR score: Ranges from 3.11 to 3.30 (higher is better), assessing the dataset’s alignment with FAIR principles.
Key Quality Indicators
Metric	Value Range / Status	Interpretation
Accuracy score	0.0 (consistently)	Potential correctness gaps.
F score	0.61 – 0.80	Moderate semantic matching performance.
A score	0.75	Reliable source structure.
FAIR score	3.11 – 3.30 (max ~4.0)	Partial FAIR compliance (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
Verifiability score	0.3316 (consistent)	Limited ability to verify claims.
Trust value	0.75	Moderate trustworthiness.
Undefined classes/properties	""-"" (not defined/measured)	Possible schema gaps or custom usage.
Critical Areas of Concern
Zero Accuracy: This may indicate missing validation against ground-truth data or structural issues in how WordNet’s RDF conversion represents linguistic relationships.
Low FAIR Scores: Suggests deficiencies in metadata richness, persistency of identifiers, or licensing clarity.
Verifiability: Scores ~0.33 imply limited support for external fact-checking.
Conclusion
While WordNet's RDF conversion demonstrates reliability (A-score: 0.75) and semantic utility (F-score: 0.61–0.8), its explicit accuracy metric is consistently reported as zero, which flags potential issues in factual correctness or validation methodology. Users should cross-reference results with trusted sources before deploying this dataset in critical NLP or AI applications.

Critical Change:

Until 2025-08-03, the dataset consistently reported dqv:value ""1"" for RDF dump availability.
On 2025-09-07, this changed to dqv:value ""0"", indicating the dump became unavailable.
Supporting Metrics:
Amount of data score dropped from 0. 
6
  (consistent until 2025-08-03) to 0. 
3
  on 2025-09-07.
Overall Score plunged from ~0.566 to 0.1 on 2025-09-07, signaling degraded quality/service.
Conclusion:
The dataset's RDF dump was consistently available until August 2025 but became unavailable in September 2025. The claim ""always set to 1"" does not hold for the full observed period.

Scope: Measurements span 2025-05-04 to 2025-09-07.
Key Decline Metrics:
Requires authentication shifted from False to ""-"" (unknown status).
Completeness score, Interoperability score, and Security score dropped to 0.0.
FAIR Compliance:
FAIR score fell from ~3.8 to 2.36, reflecting reduced adherence to FAIR principles.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_3,Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?,"No, it is discontinuous","Based on the provided dataset quality measurements, the RDF data dump for the Allie Abbreviation Database is not reliably up-to-date or consistently available. Here is a technical breakdown:

Key Evidence Summary
RDF Dump Availability (Metadata)

2025-05-04, 2025-06-01, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03: Value ""1""
2025-09-07: Value ""0""
Indicates no RDF dump was detected in the metadata on 2025-09-07.
RDF Dump Availability (Query)

All measurements (2025-05-04 to 2025-08-03): ""False""
2025-09-07: ""-""
Confirms dump URLs were invalid via direct checks in most periods.
Dataset Download URLs

URL for download the dataset consistently returns ""[]""
(e.g., measurements on 2025-05-04, 2025-06-01, etc.).
No valid download link is provided.
FAIR Score Collapse

FAIR score drops from 3.88 (2025-07-13) to 2.36 (2025-09-07).
Decline coincides with accessibility issues (Availability score = 0.0 on 2025-09-07).
Modification Timestamps

Modification date entries are ""False"" or ""-"" throughout.
No evidence of recent updates.
Conclusions
🚫 Persistent Unavailability: The RDF dump is not reliably accessible (Availability of RDF dump is inconsistent).
📉 Declining Quality Metrics: Significant drop in FAIR score, Availability score, and other KPIs in late 2025.
🔄 No Update Traces: Lagging Age of data (2011-08-01 persistent) and missing Modification date suggest staleness.
Recommendations
Verify dump status directly via http://allie.dbcls.jp/.
Monitor void:sparqlEndpoint availability: http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql.
Check for dataset updates/notices from the publisher (Database Center for Life Science).

TA_4,Is the accuracy of NoiPA constant over time?,No,"Based on the provided quality measurements, I have analyzed the Accuracy score for the NoiPA dataset over time. Here's a structured summary:

🎯 Key Findings: Accuracy Score Timeline
Measurement Date	Accuracy Score	Observations
2025-05-04	0.9997	First recorded value
2025-06-01	0.9997	Unchanged from May
2025-07-13	0.99966	↓ Small decrease (-0.00004)
2025-08-03	0.99966	No change from July
2025-09-07	0.99966	No change from August
Stability Period:

Accuracy remained constant (0.9997) from May to June 2025.
A minor drop (Δ = -0.00004) occurred between June and July 2025.
Stabilized at 0.99966 from July through September 2025.
Statistical Insight:
The relative change in accuracy is minimal (\text{\\sim 0.004\\%}), suggesting near-constant behavior despite technical fluctuations.

Comparison to Other Metrics:
Unlike accuracy, other scores (e.g., F-score ↓ from 0.76 to 0.57, FAIR score ↓ from 2.76 to 2.57) show more volatility over the same period.

🧠 Conclusion
No, the accuracy of NoiPA is not strictly constant but demonstrates high stability (<1% variation) over the observed period.
The minor change in July 2025 likely reflects dataset updates or measurement refinements, not a systemic accuracy decline.
For critical applications, monitor complementary metrics like F-score or FAIR score that show more sensitivity to changes.
For further investigation, I recommend correlating accuracy drops with:

Dataset modification dates (Modification date in the data).
Changes in related metrics (e.g., Consistency score or Conciseness score).

2025-08-03	0.99966	Yes
2025-09-07	0.99966	Yes
Change Analysis:

The accuracy decreased marginally by 0.00004 (from 0.9997 to 0.99966) between June and July 2025.
No fluctuations observed after July 2025 – the score stabilizes at 0.99966 for 3 consecutive measurements.
Conclusion
Not perfectly consistent: A minor accuracy decrease occurred in mid-2025 (∣Δ∣=0.00004).
Highly stable post-July 2025: The accuracy score remained locked at 0.99966 for the subsequent measurements.

Key Findings
Measurement Results:

All recorded measurements for the ""Time elapsed since last modification"" quality metric (on 2025-05-04, 2025-06-01, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03, and 2025-09-07) show value: ""-"".
This indicates no modifications were detected during the entire observation period.
Dataset Characteristics:

The dataset has a monthly update frequency (dqv:value ""['Monthly']"" confirmed in multiple measurements).
The oldest recorded data is from August 2011 (dqv:value ""2011-08-01"" for ""Age of data"" metric).
Uninterrupted Operation:

Since the first recorded measurement on 2025-05-04 to the latest on 2025-09-07, the dataset has been:
Consistently accessible (SPARQL endpoint marked as ""Available"" in all valid measurements)
Stable without modifications (no recorded changes in the measurement period).
Calculated Uptime
Maximum confirmed uptime=2025-09-07−2025-05-04=126 days

Limitations
Hypothetical measurement dates (year 2025 suggests test/simulated data)
No explicit ""created date"" in provided metadata
""-"" values indicate absence of version changes rather than downtime
Conclusion
Without explicit modification events and given available data, the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset has maintained continuous uninterrupted availability for at least 126 days (May 4, 2025 to September 7, 2025) per the measurements, with no detected changes to its data dump during this period.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,

Key Takeaways
No significant improvements were observed in major dimensions (e.g., Performance, F-Score, Reputation) from August to September 2025.
Most metrics remained stable or declined slightly.
New dimensions like Extensional conciseness (for bpr) were introduced, potentially signaling a shift in evaluation focus.
Top Performing Datasets (September 2025)
NoiPA: Perfect Performance score (1.0) and high Accuracy score (0.99966).
dblp-kg: Performance score (1.0) and Availability score (0.75).
bpr: Stable in Performance score and RDF compliance (Use RDF structures = True).

E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The Availability score for the DBLP dataset equals 1.0 on certain dates (e.g., 2025-08-03, 2025-07-13, 2025-05-04) due to the satisfaction of critical availability-related metrics, primarily:

1. Persistent Metadata Availability
A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources = 1 (across all measurements).
Availability for download (metadata) = 1 (metadata consistently downloadable).
Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1 (metadata RDF dump always available).
2. Accessibility via SPARQL Endpoint
Sparql endpoint = ""Available"" (ensuring query-based access).
This contrasts with other datasets (e.g., bpr or LemmaBank), where the endpoint is unavailable or partially functional.
3. Comparison to Other Datasets
Dataset	Availability Score (Example Date)	Key Deficiencies
dblp-kg	1.0 (2025-08-03)	None (full compliance)
bpr	0.5	Missing RDF dumps/downloads
LemmaBank	0.5	Same as bpr
Why Not Always 1.0?
On 2025-09-07, DBLP's availability score dropped to 0.75, likely due to transient issues in one or more submetrics (e.g., temporary SPARQL downtime or metadata unavailability). The score varies over time based on real-time checks.

The availability score likely follows a weighted sum of submetrics:

Availability Score=w 
1
​
 ⋅A1-M+w 
2
​
 ⋅Downloadable+w 
3
​
 ⋅SPARQL_Available
When all submetrics = 1, score = 1.0 (e.g., DBLP on 2025-08-03).
If any submetric fails (e.g., SPARQL endpoint = Unavailable), the score decreases.
Example calculation for DBLP on 2025-09-07:

Why Scores Lower at Other Times?
On 2025-06-01 (score = 0.5), Availability for download (query) was ""False"".
On 2025-09-07 (score = 0.75), QoS dips likely due to temporary endpoint/dump unavailability.

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for the ""Amount of data score"" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty. Here's why:

Key Observations:
Metric Definition:

The metric Amount of data score aggregates sub-metrics related to data volume/coverage (e.g., triples, entities, metadata richness).
Its value ranges in [0,1], where 1 = best, 0 = worst.
A score of 0 indicates extreme inadequacy in data volume/coverage but doesn't imply complete emptiness.
Data in the Provided Measurements:

No dataset scored 0 in Amount of data score (all values are ≥0.333).
For example:
dblp-kg and LemmaBank consistently score 0.333.
NoiPA and bpr score 0.666.
This suggests even low-scoring datasets have some data.
Supporting Evidence:

Other metrics (e.g., Number of triples, Number of blank nodes) confirm datasets are not empty:
dblp-kg has millions of blank nodes (e.g., 274,883,356 on 2025-09-07).
NoiPA has 35,560,087 labels/comments (2025-08-03).
Why a Score of 0 ≠ Empty Dataset?
A score of 0 could arise from:
Partial emptiness (e.g., missing metadata, sparse entities).
Technical failure in metric calculation (e.g., ""insufficient data"" flags).
Weighted penalties across sub-metrics (e.g., missing interoperability features).
Example: A dataset with 1 triple but no metadata/licenses might score 0, but isn't technically ""empty"".
Summary Table for Clarity:
Metric	Score = 0 Implies...	Empty Dataset?
Amount of data score	Severe lack of data/coverage	❌ No
Completeness score	Missing critical fields	❌ No
Number of triples = 0	No factual data	✅ Yes
Conclusion: Use specific measurements (e.g., Number of triples) to confirm emptiness. A score of 0 in Amount of data score is a warning sign but requires further inspection.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. Here's the reasoning:

Key Observations
Metric Definition:
The ""Amount of data score"" is defined as:

""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"".
Its output range is [0, 1] (where 1 is best).

Scaling vs. Absolute Zero:
A score of 0 indicates the lowest possible valuation across all metrics in this category (e.g., small size, poor metadata coverage, scalability issues). It does not imply that the dataset has zero triples/entities.

Supporting Evidence:
In the data, metrics like Number of triples (metadata) are explicitly measured separately, e.g., for dblp-kg:


dblp-kg/2025-08-03/Number of triples (metadata) dqv:value ""0"";
Even when this metric is 0, the dataset still has non-zero measurements elsewhere (e.g., entities, labels), proving data exists.

Interpreting Scores:

Score = 0.333: Low data volume (e.g., CIDOC-CRM, LemmaBank)
Score = 0.666: Moderate data volume (e.g., NoiPA, bpr)
No dataset in the file scores 0, but if one did, it would signify critically insufficient data relative to benchmarks—not emptiness.

Mathematical Interpretation:
Let the amount-of-data score S be defined as:
S=w 
1
​
 m 
1
​
 +w 
2
​
 m 
2
​
 +⋯+w 
n
​
 m 
n
​
 
where w 
i
​
  are weights, and m 
i
​
  are normalized sub-metrics (e.g., triple count, entity count, etc.).

A score of 0 means the dataset performs at the minimum threshold for all sub-metrics, not that m 
i
​
 =0 ∀ i.

Example:
If metrics like Number of triples and Entities are low but non-zero (e.g., m 
1
​
 =0.1, m 
2
​
 =0.05), poor performance in other dimensions (e.g., metadata) could still drive S→0.

Conclusion
A score of 0 reflects extremely poor performance in data volume/scalability metrics—not necessarily an empty dataset. Always check granular metrics (e.g., triple counts) to confirm actual data presence.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Based on the provided RDF data, the Availability score (value = 1) does NOT necessarily mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are functional simultaneously. Here's the breakdown:

Key Findings
Metric Definition:
The <http://example.org/Quality-Metric/A1-D%20Working%20access%20point%28s%29> defines scoring logic as:

1.0: Operational SPARQL or accessible data dump
0.5: Accessible SPARQL or data dump
0: Otherwise
This means either an available SPARQL endpoint OR an accessible dump suffices for a score of 1.0.

Dataset Examples:

dblp-kg (2025-08-03):
SPARQL endpoint = ""Available"" ✅
RDF dump availability = ""False"" ❌
Availability score = 1.0
→ Valid with just SPARQL operational.
bpr (2025-09-07):
SPARQL endpoint = ""Available"" ✅
RDF dump availability = ""False"" ❌
Availability score = 0.5
→ Discrepancy suggests score aggregation varies per dataset.
Conclusion
An Availability score of 1.0 indicates at least one access point (SPARQL endpoint OR RDF dump) is fully operational. Both are not required simultaneously. The metric prioritizes functional accessibility, not necessarily redundancy.

E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"Based on the provided data quality measurements and metric definitions, an Availability Score of 1 does not necessarily mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF dump are fully operational. Here's the breakdown:

Key Findings
Availability Score Composition
The Availability score likely aggregates results from multiple sub-metrics:

SPARQL endpoint availability (Sparql endpoint)
RDF dump availability (via metadata or direct query)
Other dimension-specific checks
Thresholds for Sub-Metrics
From metric definitions:

SPARQL endpoint: Values are ""Available"", ""Offline"", or ""-"" (missing)
RDF dump checks (via metadata query):
0 = offline, 1 = online, -1 = missing
A1-D Working access point(s) metric:
1 = operational SPARQL or accessible data dump
0.5 = partial accessibility
0 = no operational access points
Real-World Example
For dblp-kg dataset on 2025-08-03:


dqv:value ""1.0""               # Availability score = 1.0
dqv:value ""Available""        # SPARQL endpoint available
dqv:value ""1""                # RDF dump online (metadata check)
dqv:value ""False""            # RDF dump offline (direct query check)
Here, the score reached 1.0 despite the RDF dump being unreachable via direct query.

Conclusion
YES: A score of 1 indicates at least one functional access method (SPARQL endpoint or RDF dump) is available.
NO: It does not guarantee both are fully operational. The score aggregates weighted checks where complete availability isn't a strict requirement.

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","No, setting the license to 1 in these measurements does not inherently guarantee that an open license is used. Here's the analysis:

1. Metric Definition
The relevant metric <http://example.org/Quality-Metric/R1.1%20Machine-%20or%20human-readable%20license%20retrievable%20via%20any%20primary%20source> defines:

Output: ""1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"".
This only checks if a license is explicitly declared, not whether it is open.
2. License Values Observed
Measurements with dqv:value ""1"" correlate with license URIs like:

cc-by-sa (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike)
cc-zero (Creative Commons Zero)
by-sa/3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0)
These are open licenses, but the metric score (1/0) does not validate openness—it only confirms license detection.

3. Licensing Score Context
The metric <http://example.org/Quality-Metric/Licensing%20score> outputs values in [0,1] and is computed from multiple licensing metrics. Example measurements show scores like 0.5 (e.g., for dblp-kg), indicating partial compliance with full openness criteria.

Key Conclusion
A value of 1 for the license-retrieval metric only confirms a license was found, not its openness. To confirm openness, you must check the specific license URI (e.g., cc-by, cc-zero) against recognized open licenses like those from:

Key Observations
Verifiability Score Definition:

Metric URI: <http://example.org/Quality-Metric/Verifiability%20score>
Output range: [0,1], where 1 is the best possible score.
Computed as a weighted combination of metrics like:
Is on a trusted provider list (boolean)
Metadata availability (A1-M, F1-M, etc.)
Provider information completeness (R1.2).
Current Measurements:

No dataset achieves 1.0 in verifiability score (highest is 0.498 for NoiPA).
All datasets (e.g., NoiPA, bpr, dblp-kg) have Is on a trusted provider list = ""False"".

Provider Information ≠ Verifiability:

Verifiability is a composite metric, while ""provider information"" is only one component (e.g., R1.2 or Is on a trusted provider list).
A verifiability score of 1 implies:
All verifiability-related metrics (trusted provider status, metadata completeness, etc.) are maximized.
Provider information may still be incomplete if other verifiability metrics compensate (though unlikely in practice).
Conclusion
A verifiability score of 1 means the dataset meets all defined criteria to verify its trustworthiness, but it does not guarantee all provider details are present (e.g., missing contact info might still be allowed if not part of the metric formula).
