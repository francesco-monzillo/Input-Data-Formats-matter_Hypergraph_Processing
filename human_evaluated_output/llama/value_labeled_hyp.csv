IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"According to the provided data, WordNet has an accuracy score of 0.000000, which indicates that it is not accurate. However, this score is likely due to the specific metrics used to evaluate accuracy, and it's important to consider other factors when assessing the accuracy of WordNet.

In general, WordNet is considered a reliable and widely-used lexical database, but like any natural language processing resource, it is not perfect and may contain errors or inconsistencies. Its accuracy can depend on various factors, such as the specific task or application, the quality of the input data, and the complexity of the linguistic phenomena being modeled.

It's also worth noting that the accuracy score mentioned earlier is likely based on a specific evaluation metric or benchmark, and different metrics or benchmarks may yield different results. Therefore, it's essential to consider multiple perspectives and evaluations when assessing the accuracy of WordNet or any other NLP resource.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,

E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The availability score is equal to 1 for the DBLP dataset because it meets all the criteria for availability, including:

* Having a working access point (A1-D)
* Being registered in a searchable engine (F4-M)
* Having metadata available via working primary sources (A1-M)
* Having metadata available via standard primary sources (F2a-M)
* Having metadata available for all the attributes covered in the FAIR score computation (F2b-M)

E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The DBLP dataset has an availability score of 1 because it meets all the criteria for availability, including:

* Having a working access point (A1-D)
* Having metadata available via working primary sources (A1-M)
* Having a common accepted media type (not applicable in this case, but it's not penalized)
* Having a VoID file (not applicable in this case, but it's not penalized)

Additionally, the dataset has a high score for other availability-related metrics, such as:

* Having a high degree of connection (I3-D)
* Having a high score for metadata availability via standard primary sources (F2a-M)
* Having a high score for metadata availability for all attributes covered in the FAIR score computation (F2b-M)

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of amount of data equal to 0 does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. It means that the metrics used to calculate the amount of data score were unable to retrieve any information about the dataset's size or content. This could be due to various reasons such as the SPARQL endpoint being missing, not online, or not responding correctly, or the VoID file not providing enough information.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","According to the provided information, the Amount of data score is a dimension that computes the overall score for the amount of data dimension as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores. The output of this dimension is a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best value.

However, it's not explicitly stated that a score of 0 means the dataset contains no data. It's possible that a score of 0 could indicate that the dataset has very little data or that the data is not well-represented in the metrics used to calculate the score.

To determine what a score of 0 actually means, you would need to look at the specific metrics used to calculate the Amount of data score and how they are weighted in the calculation. Additionally, you may want to consider other factors such as the size of the dataset, the number of entities and properties, and the complexity of the data model.

It's also worth noting that the Amount of data score is just one aspect of the overall quality of a dataset, and a low score in this dimension does not necessarily mean that the dataset is useless or without value. Other dimensions, such as accuracy, consistency, and interpretability, may be more important depending on the specific use case and requirements of the dataset.",0.5,0.5,0.5,,"0,5",,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Yes, when the availability score is 1, it means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"According to the provided information, the Availability score is a linear combination of individual availability metrics scores. However, it doesn't explicitly state that a score of 1 means both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.

But, looking at the ""Availability of RDF dump (query)"" and ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" metrics, we can see that they return 1 if the RDF dump is online, and 0 if it's offline. Similarly, the ""Sparql endpoint"" metric returns ""Available"" if the SPARQL endpoint is online.

Given this information, it's likely that an Availability score of 1 means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available (i.e., online). However, without more explicit information, we can't be 100% sure.",0.5,0.5,0.5,,"0,5",,,,,,
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","According to the provided data, the ""License machine redeable (metadata)"" metric has a value of 1 when a license is detected in the VoID description or in the dataset itself. However, this does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.

The data also includes specific licenses, such as ""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by"" and ""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"", which are open licenses. But the presence of a license (value of 1) does not guarantee that it is an open license.

To determine if an open license is used, you would need to check the specific license value, such as ""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by"" or ""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"", which indicates an open license.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Yes, if the license is set to 1, it means that an open license is used.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"No, if verifiability is set to 1, it doesn't necessarily mean that all information about providers is set. Verifiability is a dimension that encompasses several metrics, including ""Is on a trusted provider list"", ""Trust value"", and ""Signed"". If verifiability is set to 1, it means that the dataset has achieved a perfect score in this dimension, but it doesn't provide information about the specific values of each metric.

In other words, a verifiability score of 1 indicates that the dataset has met all the criteria for verifiability, but it doesn't reveal the underlying values of each metric. To determine if all information about providers is set, you would need to check the specific values of each metric, such as ""Is on a trusted provider list"" and ""Trust value"".
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available. The verifiability score is a measure of how well the provider information is described, but it does not guarantee that all information is present.

According to the definition, the verifiability score is ""Meta-information about the identity of information provider"" and the input is ""Metadata"". This means that the score is based on the metadata provided, but it does not necessarily cover all aspects of provider information.

Therefore, even with a verifiability score of 1, there might still be some provider information missing or not described in the metadata.
