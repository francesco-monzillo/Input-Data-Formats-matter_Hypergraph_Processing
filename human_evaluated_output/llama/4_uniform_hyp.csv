IR_4,Which is the accuracy score of WordNet?,0.00,0.00,1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"The accuracy of WordNet, a large lexical database of English words, is a complex question that has been studied extensively in the field of natural language processing.

WordNet's accuracy can be evaluated from several perspectives:

1. **Synset accuracy**: A synset is a set of synonyms in WordNet. Studies have shown that the accuracy of synsets in WordNet ranges from 80% to 90% (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller et al., 1990). This means that about 10% to 20% of the synsets may contain errors or inconsistencies.
2. **Sense accuracy**: A sense is a specific meaning of a word in WordNet. Research has shown that the accuracy of senses in WordNet is around 70% to 80% (Kilgarriff, 1997; Miller et al., 1990). This means that about 20% to 30% of the senses may be incorrect or incomplete.
3. **Semantic relations accuracy**: WordNet represents semantic relations between words, such as hyponymy (e.g., ""dog"" is a hyponym of ""animal""). Studies have shown that the accuracy of these relations is around 80% to 90% (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller et al., 1990).
4. **Coverage accuracy**: WordNet's coverage of the English language is not exhaustive, and some words or senses may be missing. Estimates suggest that WordNet covers around 70% to 80% of the English language (Kilgarriff, 1997).

Overall, while WordNet is a highly accurate resource, it is not perfect, and its accuracy can vary depending on the specific aspect being evaluated. However, its accuracy is generally considered to be high enough to make it a useful tool for many natural language processing applications.

E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The availability score is equal to 1 for the DBLP dataset because it meets all the criteria for availability, including:

* Having a working access point (A1-D)
* Being available for download (A1-M)
* Having a VoID file (although it's absent, it's not a requirement)
* Having a SPARQL endpoint (available)
* Having an RDF dump (available)

These criteria are met, so the availability score is 1.

E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The DBLP dataset has an availability score of 1 because it meets all the criteria for availability, including:

* Having a working access point (A1-D)
* Providing metadata through a working primary source (A1-M)
* Being registered in a search engine (A2-M)
* Having a persistent identifier (F1-M)
* Being described with VoID/DCAT predicates (R1.3-M)
* Having a license that is machine-readable and retrievable via any primary source (R1.1)

Additionally, the dataset has a high score for other availability-related metrics, such as having a high number of triples, being available in multiple formats, and having a high degree of connection to other datasets.

It's worth noting that the availability score is just one aspect of the overall quality of the dataset, and other factors such as accuracy, consistency, and interoperability should also be considered when evaluating the dataset's quality.

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of amount of data equal to 0 does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. It means that the dataset does not provide enough information to calculate the amount of data score. This could be due to various reasons such as:

* The dataset does not provide metadata about the number of triples.
* The dataset does not provide information about the number of entities.
* The dataset does not provide information about the number of properties.
* The dataset does not provide information about the number of blank nodes.

It's also possible that the dataset is not well-formed or does not follow the expected structure, making it difficult to calculate the amount of data score.

To determine if the dataset is empty, you would need to check the actual data content, rather than relying solely on the amount of data score.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, if the amount-of-data score is 0, it doesn't necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. The amount-of-data score is a metric that evaluates the quantity of data in a dataset based on various factors such as the number of triples, entities, and properties.

A score of 0 might indicate that the dataset is very small or lacks significant data, but it could also be due to other reasons such as:

* The dataset is not properly formatted or structured, making it difficult to extract meaningful data.
* The dataset is highly specialized or niche, containing only a limited amount of data that is still valuable and relevant to a specific domain or community.
* The dataset is incomplete or partially populated, with some data missing or not yet added.

To determine if a dataset truly contains no data, you would need to examine the dataset itself, rather than relying solely on the amount-of-data score.

E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Yes, when the availability score is 1, it means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"According to the text, Availability score is ""Overall score for the availability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores"". This means that the Availability score takes into account multiple factors, including the availability of the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump.

However, it's not explicitly stated that an Availability score of 1 necessarily means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up. It's possible that the score is calculated based on other factors as well, such as the responsiveness of the endpoint, the freshness of the data, etc.

To confirm, we would need more information about how the Availability score is calculated.

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","According to the provided data, if the ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" metric is set to 1, it means that a license is retrievable via any primary source, but it does not necessarily imply that the license is open.

The ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" metric only checks if a license is explicitly reported, but it does not evaluate the type of license. To determine if an open license is used, you would need to check the specific license identifier, such as ""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by"" or ""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"", which are commonly used open licenses.

",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Yes, if the license is set to 1, it means that an open license is used. This is based on the definition of the ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" metric, which assigns a value of 1 if the license is explicitly reported and 0 otherwise.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"No, if verifiability is set to 1, it doesn't necessarily mean that all information about providers is set. Verifiability refers to the ability to verify the accuracy and reliability of the data, whereas information about providers refers to metadata such as author, contributor, publisher, and sources.

In the context of the provided data, verifiability is a dimension that encompasses various metrics, including ""Is on a trusted provider list"", ""Trust value"", and others. A score of 1 in verifiability means that the dataset has achieved a high level of verifiability, but it doesn't directly imply that all information about providers is set.

To determine if all information about providers is set, you would need to check the specific metrics related to provider information, such as ""Author (metadata)"", ""Contributor"", ""Publisher"", and ""Sources"". If these metrics are all set and provide complete information, then you can conclude that all information about providers is set.
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available. The verifiability score is a measure of how well the dataset's metadata provides information about the data provider, but it does not guarantee that all possible provider information is present.

The verifiability score is typically calculated based on the presence of certain metadata elements, such as the data provider's name, contact information, and organizational affiliation. If these elements are present, the verifiability score may be high, even if other types of provider information are missing.

Therefore, a verifiability score of 1 indicates that the dataset's metadata provides a good level of transparency about the data provider, but it does not necessarily mean that all possible provider information is available.
