E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The availability score is equal to 1 for the DBLP dataset because it meets all the criteria for availability, including:

* Having a working access point (A1-D)
* Providing metadata availability via working primary sources (A1-M)
* Being registered in a searchable engine (F4-M)
* Having a high throughput (high_throughput)
* Having a low latency (low_latency)

These criteria indicate that the dataset is easily accessible, well-maintained, and provides a good user experience, resulting in a perfect availability score of 1.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The DBLP dataset has an availability score of 1 because it meets all the criteria for availability, including:

* Having a working access point (A1-D)
* Providing metadata through a standard primary source (A1-M)
* Having a machine-readable license (R1.1)
* Being registered in a searchable engine (F4-M)
* Having a high degree of connection (I3-D)

Additionally, the dataset has a high score for other availability-related metrics, such as having a high number of triples linked and being available for download in various formats.

It's worth noting that the availability score is just one aspect of the overall FAIR score, and the dataset may have varying scores for other dimensions such as findability, interoperability, and reusability.
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of amount of data equals to 0 does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. It means that the metrics used to calculate the amount of data score were unable to retrieve any information about the dataset, likely due to the SPARQL endpoint being missing or not online, or an error during the execution of the SPARQL query.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, if the amount-of-data score is 0, it doesn't necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. 

The amount-of-data score is a metric that evaluates the quantity of data in a dataset based on various factors such as the number of triples, entities, and properties. A score of 0 might indicate that the dataset has a very small amount of data or that the data is not well-represented in the metrics used to calculate the score.

There could be several reasons why a dataset receives an amount-of-data score of 0, including:

1. The dataset is very small, containing only a few triples or entities.
2. The dataset is not well-structured or lacks metadata, making it difficult to calculate the amount-of-data score.
3. The metrics used to calculate the amount-of-data score are not suitable for the specific dataset.

It's essential to consider the context and the specific metrics used to calculate the amount-of-data score to understand what a score of 0 means for a particular dataset.

E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"According to the text, when the availability score is 1, it means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF dump are online.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"According to the provided information, the Availability score is a linear combination of individual availability metrics scores. However, it doesn't explicitly state that a score of 1 means both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.

But, looking at the individual metrics, we can see that:

* ""Availability of RDF dump (query)"" checks if the RDF dump is provided and can be downloaded.
* ""Sparql endpoint"" checks if the server responds to a SPARQL query.

If both of these metrics are true, it's likely that the Availability score would be 1. However, without more information, we can't be certain.

It's also worth noting that the Availability score is a dimension of the FAIR principles, which stands for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. So, even if the Availability score is 1, it doesn't necessarily mean that the data is fully FAIR-compliant.

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","According to the provided data, if the ""License machine redeable (metadata)"" or ""License machine redeable (query)"" is set to 1, it means that a license is indicated in the VoID description or in the dataset itself, but it does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.

The actual license used is specified by the value associated with the ""License machine redeable (metadata)"" or ""License machine redeable (query)"", which can be a specific license identifier, such as ""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by"" or ""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"".

To determine if an open license is used, you would need to check the specific license identifier and verify that it is an open license.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Yes, if the license is set to 1, it means that an open license is used.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"No, if verifiability is set to 1, it means that the information about providers is available, but it doesn't necessarily mean that all information about providers is set.

Verifiability is a dimension that measures the extent to which the data is accurate, reliable, and trustworthy. A verifiability score of 1 indicates that the data is highly verifiable, meaning that it is well-documented, transparent, and easy to verify.

However, the presence of information about providers is just one aspect of verifiability. Other factors, such as data quality, data provenance, and data curation, also contribute to the overall verifiability score.

Therefore, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily imply that all information about providers is set. It only indicates that the data is highly verifiable, and that the information about providers is likely to be accurate and reliable.
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, the verifiability score being 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available. The verifiability score is a measure of how well the dataset's metadata is verified, but it does not directly relate to the availability of provider information.

The availability of provider information is measured by other metrics, such as ""Publisher"" and ""Contributor"", which are separate from the verifiability score. These metrics assess whether the dataset provides information about the publisher and contributors, respectively.

Therefore, a verifiability score of 1 indicates that the dataset's metadata is well-verified, but it does not guarantee that all provider information is available.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
