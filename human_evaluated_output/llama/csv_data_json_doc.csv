TA_3,Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?,"No, it is discontinuous","According to the data, the availability of the RDF dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset varies across different entries. Some entries indicate that the RDF dump is available (True), while others indicate that it is not available (False) or that the information is missing (-). Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the data dump is always up.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_4,Is the accuracy of NoiPA constant over time?,No,"Based on the provided data, we can see that the accuracy of NoiPA is not constant over time.

The accuracy score is calculated as a linear combination of individual accuracy metrics scores, and it is represented as a float value between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best value.

Looking at the data, we can see that the accuracy score of NoiPA changes over time:

* On 2025-04-17, the accuracy score is 0.9833.
* On 2025-05-04, the accuracy score is 0.9833.
* On 2025-05-05, the accuracy score is 0.9833.
* On 2025-06-01, the accuracy score is 0.9833.
* On 2025-07-13, the accuracy score is 0.9833.
* On 2025-07-18, the accuracy score is 0.9833.
* On 2025-08-03, the accuracy score is 0.9833.
* On 2025-08-04, the accuracy score is 0.9833.

Although the accuracy score remains the same (0.9833) across different dates, this does not necessarily mean that the accuracy of NoiPA is constant over time. The accuracy score is a calculated value based on individual accuracy metrics scores, and these underlying metrics may have changed over time, even if the overall accuracy score remains the same.

To determine if the accuracy of NoiPA is truly constant over time, we would need to examine the individual accuracy metrics scores and see if they have changed over time. If the individual metrics scores have changed, but the overall accuracy score remains the same, then the accuracy of NoiPA is not constant over time.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
TA_4,Does the accuracy of NoiPA remain consistent over time?,No,"Based on the provided data, we can analyze the accuracy of NoiPA over time.

The accuracy score is calculated as a linear combination of individual accuracy metrics scores. The accuracy scores for NoiPA are:

* 2025-04-17: 0.9833 (out of 10000 triples considered)
* 2025-05-04: 0.9827 (out of 10000 triples considered)
* 2025-05-05: 0.9833 (out of 10000 triples considered)
* 2025-06-01: 0.9827 (out of 10000 triples considered)
* 2025-07-13: 0.9827 (out of 10000 triples considered)

The accuracy scores for NoiPA remain relatively consistent over time, with a slight variation of 0.0006 between the highest and lowest scores. This suggests that the accuracy of NoiPA remains stable and consistent over the observed period.

However, it's essential to note that the accuracy score is just one aspect of the overall quality of NoiPA. Other factors, such as the number of triples, entities, and properties, may also impact the quality of the dataset.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of NoiPA's quality over time, it would be beneficial to analyze other metrics, such as the number of triples, entities, and properties, as well as other quality dimensions like consistency, conciseness, and understandability.

Co_2,Which is the worst performing dataset in the license metric?,CIDOC-CRM,"The worst performing dataset in the license metric is the one with the lowest ""Licensing score"". However, since the provided text does not include the actual scores, we cannot determine which dataset is the worst performing.

But we can see that some datasets have a ""License machine redeable (query)"" or ""License machine redeable (metadata)"" value of ""False"", indicating that the license is not indicated or not machine-readable. These datasets might be considered as poorly performing in the license metric.

For example, the dataset ""CIDOC-CRM"" has a ""License machine redeable (query)"" value of ""False"", indicating that the license is not machine-readable. Similarly, the dataset ""allie-abbreviation-and-long-form-database-in-life-science"" has a ""License machine redeable (query)"" value of ""False"".

E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The availability score is equal to 1 for the DBLP dataset because it meets all the criteria for high availability. Specifically:

* The dataset has a SPARQL endpoint that is online and responsive.
* The dataset provides an RDF dump that is online and downloadable.
* The dataset has a clear license (CC0) that allows for free use and reuse of the data.

These factors contribute to a high availability score, indicating that the dataset is easily accessible and usable by others.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,

* The dataset is available as a SPARQL endpoint, which allows users to query the data programmatically.
* The dataset is available for download as an RDF dump, which allows users to access the data offline.
* The dataset is licensed under a permissive license (CC0), which allows users to reuse and redistribute the data freely.
* The dataset is regularly updated, with a modification date of less than 1 year ago.

These factors contribute to a high availability score, indicating that the dataset is easily accessible and usable by others.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of amount of data equal to 0 does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. 

According to the description of the metric ""Amount of data score"", it is ""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"". This means that the score is a combination of several metrics, including ""Number of triples (query)"", ""Number of triples (metadata)"", ""Number of entities"", ""Number of entities counted with regex"", ""Number of property"".

If the score is 0, it could mean that one or more of these metrics are 0, but it does not necessarily mean that the dataset is completely empty. For example, the dataset might have some entities but no triples, or it might have some triples but no entities.

To determine if a dataset is empty, you would need to check the individual metrics that make up the ""Amount of data score"", rather than just relying on the overall score.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","According to the provided information, the ""Amount of data score"" is a metric that computes a linear combination of individual amount of data metrics scores. If the ""Amount of data score"" is 0, it doesn't necessarily mean that the dataset contains no data.

However, it could indicate that the dataset has a very small amount of data or that the data is not properly formatted or accessible, resulting in a low score. To determine if the dataset actually contains no data, you would need to examine the individual amount of data metrics scores and the dataset itself.

In the provided data, there are several instances where the ""Amount of data score"" is 0, but the ""Number of triples (query)"" and ""Number of entities"" are not zero, indicating that the dataset does contain some data.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Yes, when the availability score is 1, it means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working. This is because the availability score is a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores, which include the availability of the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump. If either of these metrics has a score of 0, the overall availability score will be less than 1. Therefore, a score of 1 indicates that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available and working properly.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"According to the provided information, the Availability score is a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores.

The individual availability metrics scores include:

* Availability of RDF dump (query)
* Availability of RDF dump (metadata)
* Availability for download (query)
* Availability for download (metadata)

If the Availability score is 1, it means that all these individual metrics have a score of 1, indicating that:

* The RDF dump is online and can be downloaded (both query and metadata).
* The SPARQL endpoint is online and responding to queries.

However, it's essential to note that the SPARQL endpoint being online does not necessarily mean that the data dump is up. The data dump could be missing or offline, but the SPARQL endpoint might still be responding to queries.

To confirm that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up, you would need to check the individual metrics scores, specifically:

* Availability of RDF dump (query) and Availability of RDF dump (metadata) should both be 1.
* The SPARQL endpoint URL should be available and responding to queries.

In summary, an Availability score of 1 indicates that the SPARQL endpoint is online, but it does not guarantee that the data dump is also available. You should verify the individual metrics scores to confirm the status of both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump.",1,0.5,1,"correct, but in the individual metrics mentioned, URI def. is missing",1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","According to the provided data, the ""License machine redeable (metadata)"" and ""License machine redeable (query)"" fields indicate whether a license is specified in the metadata or query results, respectively. However, it does not necessarily imply that the license is open.

To determine if an open license is used, you would need to examine the actual license text or identifier provided in the ""License machine redeable (metadata)"" or ""License machine redeable (query)"" fields.

For example, in the provided data, some entries have a license specified as ""https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"" or ""http://w3id.org/italia/controlled-vocabulary/licences/A21_CCBY40"", which are open licenses. However, without examining the specific license text or identifier, it's impossible to conclude that a value of 1 in the ""License machine redeable"" field always means an open license is used.

It's also worth noting that the ""License human redeable"" field indicates whether a human-readable license is provided, but it does not provide information about the openness of the license.

Therefore, to accurately determine if an open license is used, you would need to examine the specific license text or identifier provided in the metadata or query results.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","According to the provided data, if `License machine redeable (metadata)` or `License machine redeable (query)` is set to 1, it means that a license is explicitly reported, but it doesn't necessarily mean that an open license is used.

To determine if an open license is used, you would need to check the actual license text or identifier, which is not provided in the given data. However, some datasets mention a specific license, such as `https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/`, which is an open license.

So, while a value of 1 in the `License machine redeable` fields indicates that a license is present, it's not a direct indicator of an open license being used. You would need to examine the license text or identifier to make that determination.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"No, if verifiability is set to 1, it doesn't necessarily mean that all information about providers is set.

According to the description of the ""Verifiability score"" metric, it is ""Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores"". This means that the verifiability score is a composite score that takes into account multiple factors related to verifiability, including but not limited to:

* Author (query)
* Author (metadata)
* Publisher
* Contributor
* Sources
* Signed

Having a verifiability score of 1 means that the dataset has achieved a perfect score in terms of verifiability, but it doesn't necessarily mean that all information about providers is set. It's possible that some of the individual verifiability metrics scores are not perfect, but the overall score is still 1 due to the linear combination of the scores.

To determine if all information about providers is set, you would need to check the individual metrics scores, such as Author (query), Author (metadata), Publisher, Contributor, Sources, and Signed, to see if they are all set to the desired values.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available. The verifiability score is a measure of the overall verifiability of the dataset, which takes into account various factors such as the availability of metadata, the presence of licenses, and the provision of provenance information.

A score of 1 indicates that the dataset has achieved the highest level of verifiability, but it does not guarantee that all provider information is available. It is possible that some provider information may still be missing or incomplete, even with a verifiability score of 1.

To determine if all provider information is available, you would need to check the specific metadata fields related to provider information, such as the ""Author"" or ""Publisher"" fields, to see if they are populated with complete and accurate information.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
