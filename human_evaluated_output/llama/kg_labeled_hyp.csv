E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The availability score is equal to 1 for the DBLP dataset because it meets all the criteria for availability, including:

* Having a working access point (A1-D)
* Being registered in a search engine (F4-M)
* Having a VoID file (although it's absent, it's not a requirement)
* Having a SPARQL endpoint (available)
* Having an RDF dump (available for download)

These factors contribute to the high availability score of the DBLP dataset.
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The DBLP dataset has an availability score of 1 because it has a working SPARQL endpoint and an RDF dump that is available for download. This means that the data is accessible and can be queried and downloaded by users, which is a key aspect of the FAIR principles.",0.5,0.5,0.5,uri deref is missing,"0,5",,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of amount of data equal to 0 does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. It means that the metrics used to calculate the amount of data score were unable to retrieve any information about the dataset's size or content. This could be due to various reasons such as the SPARQL endpoint being missing or not online, or the dataset not providing any information about its size or content.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","According to the provided text, the Amount of data score is a dimension that computes the overall score for the amount of data dimension as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores. The output of this dimension is a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best value.

However, it's not explicitly stated that a score of 0 means the dataset contains no data. It's possible that a score of 0 could indicate that the dataset has very little data or that the data is not well-represented in the metrics used to calculate the score.

To determine what a score of 0 actually means, you would need more information about how the Amount of data score is calculated and what specific metrics are used to determine the score.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Yes, when the availability score is 1, it means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"According to the information provided, if the Availability score is 1, it means that the SPARQL endpoint is online and available, but it does not necessarily mean that the data dump is also available.

The Availability score is based on the following metrics:

* A1-D Working access point(s): This metric checks if the SPARQL endpoint is online and available.
* A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources: This metric checks if the metadata is available through the SPARQL endpoint or other primary sources.

However, there is another metric called ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" that specifically checks if the data dump is available. If this metric is also 1, then it means that the data dump is available.

So, to answer your question, an Availability score of 1 only guarantees that the SPARQL endpoint is online, but it does not necessarily mean that the data dump is also available. You would need to check the ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" metric to confirm that the data dump is available.

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","According to the provided data, if the ""License machine redeable (query)"" or ""License machine redeable (metadata)"" is set to 1, it means that a license is indicated in the VoID description or in the dataset itself, but it does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.

However, if the ""License machine redeable (query)"" or ""License machine redeable (metadata)"" is set to a specific open license (e.g., ""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"", ""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by""), then it means that an open license is used.

Additionally, the ""Licensing score"" is a separate metric that is calculated based on the licensing metrics scores, and a high score indicates that the dataset is more likely to use an open license.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Yes, if the license is set to 1, it means that an open license is used. This is based on the definition of the ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" metric, which states that a value of 1 indicates that the license is explicitly reported and is an open license.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"No, if verifiability is set to 1, it means that the information about the provider is available, but it doesn't necessarily mean that all information about providers is set.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available. The verifiability score is a measure of the availability of certain metadata, such as author, contributor, publisher, and sources, but it does not guarantee that all provider information is present.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
