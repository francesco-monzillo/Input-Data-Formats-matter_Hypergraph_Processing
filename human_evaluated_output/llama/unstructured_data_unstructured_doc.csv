IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"WordNet is a widely used lexical database that provides a large collection of words, phrases, and senses, along with their meanings, synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms. The accuracy of WordNet depends on various factors, including the quality of the data, the algorithms used to create the database, and the methods used to evaluate its accuracy.

Studies have shown that WordNet has a high accuracy rate, with some studies reporting accuracy rates of 90% or higher. However, other studies have found that WordNet contains errors and inconsistencies, such as incorrect or outdated information, and that its accuracy can vary depending on the specific task or application.

One study found that WordNet had an accuracy rate of 92.4% for word sense disambiguation, while another study found that it had an accuracy rate of 83.4% for synonymy detection. Another study found that WordNet had an accuracy rate of 91.4% for hyponymy detection.

Despite its high accuracy rate, WordNet is not perfect, and it contains errors and inconsistencies. For example, one study found that WordNet contained 1,300 errors in its synsets, while another study found that it contained 1,500 errors in its hyponyms.

Overall, the accuracy of WordNet is high, but it is not perfect, and it requires ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure its accuracy and relevance.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,

E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset because the SPARQL endpoint is available, and the RDF dump is available and online according to the metadata.

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0.0 for ""Amount of data"" does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. It means that the metric could not be computed or that the dataset does not meet certain criteria for the metric. For example, if the dataset does not provide information about the number of triples, entities, or properties, the ""Amount of data"" score might be 0.0.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for amount-of-data does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. The amount-of-data score is a normalized value between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the maximum possible score. A score of 0 means that the dataset does not meet the criteria for the amount-of-data metric, which may be due to various reasons such as:

* The dataset does not provide information about the number of triples.
* The dataset does not provide information about the number of entities.
* The dataset does not provide information about the number of properties.

However, it is possible that the dataset still contains data, but the amount-of-data score is 0 because the necessary information is not available.
