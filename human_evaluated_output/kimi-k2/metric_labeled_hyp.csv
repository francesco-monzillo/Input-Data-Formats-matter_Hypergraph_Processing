TA_2,Is the DBLP SPARQL endpoint always up?,Yes,"Based on the assessment data provided, the DBLP SPARQL endpoint is highly reliable but not guaranteed to be ""always"" up.
What the data shows:
Availability Metrics:
Status: Consistently marked as ""Available"" across multiple measurement dates (May, July, August, September 2025)
Endpoint URL: https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql
Availability Score: Ranges from 0.75 to 1.0 (75% to 100%), with most readings at or near 1.0
Performance: Very low latency (0.1-0.2ms median) and consistent throughput (6-8 requests/second)
Inactive Links: Mostly ""False"" (meaning links are active), though one measurement shows ""True"" on 2025-09-07
Important Caveats:
Snapshot limitations: The data only captures specific measurement points, not continuous uptime monitoring
Not perfect: The availability score occasionally drops below 1.0, indicating occasional accessibility issues
Future data: These measurements are from 2025, which is beyond my knowledge cutoff
Conclusion:
The DBLP SPARQL endpoint demonstrates excellent availability based on the metrics, with consistent performance and very high uptime scores. However, like any web service, it's subject to occasional maintenance windows, network issues, or other temporary disruptions. For production-critical applications, you should implement appropriate error handling and fallback strategies rather than assuming 100% uptime.

2025-08-03: 1.000000 (Available)
2025-09-07: 0.000000 (Not Available)
Analysis:
The RDF dump was consistently available (value = 1) for the first four observation dates spanning May through August 2025. However, on September 7, 2025, the availability dropped to 0, indicating the data dump became unavailable or inaccessible at that point.
This pattern suggests a change in the dataset's distribution status around early September 2025, possibly due to server issues, maintenance, or a policy change regarding data dumps.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_3,Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?,"No, it is discontinuous","Based on the monitoring data, the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset's RDF dump is NOT consistently available through online query endpoints. Here's what the data shows:

Offline Dump Access:
However, offline dumps are consistently available via FTP:
ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz
Conclusion:
The dataset is not reliably accessible through live SPARQL queries or direct online RDF dumps during the observed period.

Top Performing Dimensions
1. Trust & Believability
Consistently high scores across nearly all datasets
Trust values range from 0.75 to 1.0 (with environment-agency-bathing-water-quality achieving perfect 1.0)
Believability scores are uniformly strong at 0.8-1.0 across datasets
Reputation scores are low for all datasets (which appears to be a characteristic of the metric rather than a performance issue)
2. Accuracy (Intrinsic Quality)
bpr: 1.0 (perfect)
dblp-kg: 1.0 (perfect)
NoiPA: 0.99966-0.99970 (near-perfect)
Datasets reporting this metric show exceptional precision
3. Conciseness (Intrinsic Quality)
bpr: 0.884
NoiPA: 0.99135-0.99165 (excellent)
dblp-kg: 0.99379-0.99383 (excellent)
All datasets perform very well in this dimension
4. Interpretability (Representational)
bpr: 0.99789
NoiPA: 1.0 (perfect)
micro-coronavirus: 0.94997 (excellent)
High scores indicate strong metadata clarity and vocabulary usage
5. Performance (Accessibility)
NoiPA: 1.0 (perfect)
dblp-kg: 1.0 (perfect)
While performance varies by dataset, these two datasets achieve flawless performance scores
Key Observations
NoiPA and dblp-kg are standout performers across multiple dimensions
The Trust dimension is remarkably consistent, suggesting reliable data provenance across the board
Accuracy and Conciseness show near-perfect scores where measured, indicating high data quality standards
Interpretability is strong in key datasets, though some (CIDOC-CRM, w3c-wordnet, bbc-programmes) lag behind at 0.0
These dimensions represent the strongest areas of RDF dataset quality as of September 2025, with Trust/Believability being the most universally high-performing dimension across all evaluated datasets.",0.5,0.5,1,"Shouldn't it be 0,5?","0,5",,,,,,
E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Based on the data dump analysis, the DBLP Knowledge Graph (dblp-kg) achieves an availability score of 1.0 during certain measurement periods because it meets all critical accessibility criteria simultaneously. Here's why:
Key Factors Contributing to Perfect Availability (1.0)
1. Fully Operational SPARQL Endpoint
""Sparql endpoint"":[""dblp-kg"",""Available""] across all measured dates (2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03, 2025-09-07)
The endpoint URL https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql is consistently accessible
2. Complete Metadata Accessibility
""A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources"": 1.000000
""F2a-M - Metadata availability via standard primary sources"": 1.000000
""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"": 1.000000
""Availability for download (metadata)"": 1.000000
3. Functional Primary Access Points
""A1-D Working access point(s)"": 1.000000
""A2-M Registered in search engines"": 1.000000
Dataset URLs are resolvable: https://dblp.org and download links are provided
4. Reliable Data Distribution
Direct download availability: URLs like https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz are provided
Multiple access methods: Both SPARQL endpoint and dump downloads are supported
High throughput: Measured at 6-8 queries/second with low latency (0.1-0.2s)
Why It's Not Always 1.0
The data also shows variations:
2025-09-07: Score dropped to 0.750000
2025-05-04: Also shows 0.975000 in a secondary entry
These variations likely reflect:
Brief maintenance windows or measurement anomalies
The linear combination formula weighting recent accessibility issues
Temporary interruptions in RDF dump query availability (though metadata remained accessible)
Conclusion
The availability score of 1.0 represents periods when DBLP's entire access infrastructure—SPARQL endpoint, metadata services, download links, and search engine registration—was 100% operational. This perfect score is achieved because DBLP is a mature, well-maintained dataset with redundant access mechanisms and reliable hosting infrastructure.
",1,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Looking at the data for dblp-kg (the DBLP Knowledge Graph), the availability score is actually not consistently 1.0—it varies across different monitoring dates:
2025-09-07: 0.750000
2025-08-03: 1.000000
2025-07-13: 1.000000
2025-05-04: 0.975000
The score fluctuates because availability is a composite metric that combines multiple access-related dimensions. The high scores (close to 1.0) are driven by strong performance across several key indicators:
Core Availability Factors for DBLP:
Working Access Points (A1-D): Consistently 1.0 - operational SPARQL endpoint and accessible data dumps
Metadata Availability via Primary Sources (A1-M): Consistently 1.0 - metadata always retrievable
SPARQL Endpoint Status: Consistently ""Available"" across all dates
RDF Dump Download (Metadata): Consistently 1.0 - dumps are always available for download
URI Dereferenceability (F1-D): Mostly 1.0 (0.9 on some dates) - URIs consistently resolve
Why It Sometimes Drops Below 1.0:
The score decreases to 0.75 or 0.975 when certain access methods are compromised:
RDF Dump via Query: Marked as False on some dates, indicating the live queryable dump is offline even though downloadable dumps remain available
This suggests temporary issues with real-time dump access, though alternative download methods still work
Comparison to Your Previous Query:
You previously asked about the Allie Abbreviation dataset having consistently stable data dump availability. Unlike Allie (which shows inconsistent availability scores ranging from 0.0 to 0.7), DBLP demonstrates robust infrastructure with redundant access methods—when one method (queryable dump) fails, others (direct download, SPARQL endpoint) remain functional, preventing the score from dropping dramatically.
The DBLP Knowledge Graph's architecture prioritizes multiple access pathways, which explains why its availability score generally remains high (≥0.75) and frequently reaches 1.0.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for Amount of data does not necessarily mean the dataset is literally empty.
Based on the metadata in the files, the Amount of data score is described as:
""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores""
With an output range of [0,1], where 1 is the best value.
A score of 0 represents the worst possible composite rating across multiple underlying metrics, which could indicate:
The dataset is empty or extremely small
The dataset is inaccessible (e.g., SPARQL endpoint is down or non-functional)
Critical metadata is missing that prevents proper evaluation
All constituent metrics score 0 due to technical issues or lack of data
For example, the data shows datasets like dblp-kg and bpr have millions/billions of triples but still score less than 1.0 (e.g., 0.333333 or 0.666667), indicating the score reflects quality and completeness of data infrastructure, not just raw size.
Bottom line: A zero score signals a critical failure in the data availability dimension, but you'd need to check the specific underlying metrics (like ""Number of triples (query)"", ""Number of entities"") to determine if the dataset is actually empty or just inaccessible/unmeasurable.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Based on the data quality framework shown in the dump, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. Here's why:
What the Score Actually Measures
The amount-of-data score is defined as:
""Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores""
Range: [0,1], where 1 is best
This is a composite score that aggregates multiple underlying metrics such as:
Number of triples (query results)
Number of entities
Number of labels/comments
What a Score of 0 Would Indicate
A score of 0 would mean complete failure to measure or access any data, which could happen if:
No SPARQL endpoint is available (many entries show ""None"" for query results)
Metadata is entirely missing (preventing alternative measurement)
All underlying metrics return 0 or are undefined
Key Insight from the Data
Looking at the actual scores in your dump, the lowest amount-of-data score is 0.333333, seen for datasets like CIDOC-CRM, LemmaBank, and dblp-kg. None reach 0, suggesting even minimal accessibility yields some non-zero score.
Bottom line: A 0 would indicate unmeasurable data, not necessarily non-existent data. The dataset could contain data that's simply inaccessible to the evaluation tools.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Based on the metrics definitions and empirical data in the file, an availability score of 1.0 typically indicates that both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF data dump are working, representing optimal overall availability.
Here's the reasoning:
Metric Definitions
The ""Availability score"" is defined as:
""Overall score for the availability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores"" with output range [0,1]. Best value: 1
Key individual metrics include:
""A1-D Working access point(s)"": Measures if at least one access point works (1.0 = operational SPARQL or accessible dump)
""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"": Checks dump accessibility (1.0 = online, 0 = offline, -1 = missing)
Empirical Evidence
The data shows clear patterns:
Score = 1.0 (both working):
dblp-kg (2025-09-07): SPARQL=Available, Dump=1.0 (online)
bpr (2025-08-03): SPARQL=Available, Dump=1.0 (online)
Score < 1.0 (only one working):
w3c-wordnet (2025-09-07): SPARQL=missing, Dump=1.0 (online)
Availability score = 0.500000
A1-D Working access point(s) = 1.0 (but composite score remains 0.5)
allie-abbreviation-and-long-form-database-in-life-science (2025-05-04): SPARQL=Available, Dump=False (offline)
Availability score = 0.703750
Conclusion
While the A1-D metric alone can reach 1.0 with just one functional access point, the composite Availability score of 1.0 requires optimal performance across all availability dimensions. In practice, this means both the SPARQL endpoint and RDF dump must be operational for the overall score to reach the maximum value of 1.0.",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"Based on the metric definitions in the data, an availability score of 1 would typically mean both access methods are operational, not just one.
The ""Availability score"" is a composite metric that combines several individual availability indicators. While the component metric ""A1-D Working access point(s)"" uses this scale:
1.0: Operational SPARQL endpoint and accessible data dump
0.5: Either operational SPARQL endpoint or accessible data dump
0.0: Neither available
The overall ""Availability score"" linearly combines multiple metrics (including A1-D, SPARQL endpoint status, dump availability checks, etc.). To reach a perfect composite score of 1.0, you would need:
SPARQL endpoint online and responding
RDF dump accessible for download
All other availability metrics at their optimal values
In practice, most datasets in the data hover around 0.5-0.75 when only one access method is available, and approach higher values (like dblp-kg's 0.975) when both are confirmed working. The score reflects the completeness of access options—a score of 1.0 indicates both primary access methods (query endpoint and data dump) are fully functional.",1,0,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Based on the data structure, a license value set to 1 (or 1.000000) in the R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source metric means that a license is explicitly reported and retrievable - it does not automatically confirm it's an open license.
Key Details from the Data Dump:
R1.1 Metric Definition:
""1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise""
This is a binary indicator for license availability, not license type.
For the Allie dataset, the value is consistently 1.000000 across multiple dates (2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03, 2025-09-07), confirming a license is present.
Actual License Content (requires checking separate metrics):
Machine-readable license (metadata): http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by
Machine-readable license (query): http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.1/jp/
Conclusion:

Open License? → You must verify the actual license URL. In this case, yes - CC-BY and CC-BY 2.1 JP are open licenses.",0.5,0.5,0.5,"Why only 0,5?","0,5",,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Based on the data, no, a license value of 1.000000 does not necessarily mean an open license is used. Here's what it actually indicates:
Understanding the Licensing Metrics
The value ""1"" you're seeing appears in two contexts:
R1.1 Metric: ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" outputs:
1: A license is explicitly reported/retrievable
0: No license is retrievable
The metric definition states: ""1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"". It only checks presence/retrievability, not the license type.
Licensing Score: Values like ""Licensing score"":[""bpr"",""0.500000"",""2025-07-13""] are composite scores (0-1 range) calculated from multiple licensing metrics.
What the Data Shows
When you see ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"":[""bpr"",""1.000000"",""2025-07-13""], this means a license was found, but you need to look at the actual license URI to determine if it's open:
Examples from the data:
""License machine redeable (metadata)"":[""dblp-kg"",""http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero"",""2025-07-13""] → CC Zero (open)
""License machine redeable (query)"":[""allie-abbreviation-and-long-form-database-in-life-science"",""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.1/jp/"",""2025-05-04""] → CC BY (open)
""License machine redeable (query)"":[""environment-agency-bathing-water-quality"",""http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence"",""2025-05-04""] → Open Government License (open)
Key Takeaway
A value of 1 confirms that a license exists and is machine/human-readable, but does not evaluate whether the license is open. To determine openness, you must examine the actual license URI/identifier provided in the detailed licensing metrics.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean all provider information is set. Looking at the data structure, verifiability is a composite metric calculated as a linear combination of several individual verifiability sub-metrics, which include:
Is on a trusted provider list (boolean: true/false)
Author (metadata) (string or false if absent)
Publisher (list or ""-"" if absent)
Contributor (list or ""-"" if absent)
Sources (string or false if absent)
Dataset URL (url or ""absent"")
A verifiability score of 1 would indicate perfect scores across ALL these components, meaning provider information is not only present but also meets other quality criteria. However, I notice several important caveats in your dataset:
No dataset achieves verifiability = 1 in the provided data. The highest scores are around 0.498 (NoiPA dataset), while most are much lower (e.g., 0.165, 0.331).
The Is on a trusted provider list metric is separate - it specifically checks if a provider is on a predefined trusted list, not whether provider metadata is complete. For example, even when Author (metadata) is provided (like ""Name: absent. email: whitehall.reply@gmail.com""), the trusted provider check still returns False.
Provider information can be partially set without achieving full verifiability. The score reflects the completeness and quality of ALL verifiability dimensions combined, not just provider metadata presence.
In short: Verifiability = 1 would require complete, high-quality provider information among other factors, but the score is an aggregate - individual provider fields might be set even when the overall score is low.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean all provider information is available.

Key Distinctions from the Data:
Verifiability Score Components:
The score appears to aggregate multiple metrics, including:
""Is on a trusted provider list"" (boolean)
""Author (metadata)"" availability
""Publisher"" information
""Sources"" documentation
""Trust value"" ratings
Machine/human-readable license retrievability
Provider Information Status (examples from data):
Even datasets with moderate verifiability scores show incomplete provider info:
dblp-kg (Verifiability: 0.331667): Publisher shown as ""[]"", Authors as ""False""
CIDOC-CRM (Verifiability: 0.331667): Author ""Name: absent. email: absent""
NoiPA (Verifiability: 0.498333): Author ""Name: absent. email: whitehall.reply@gmail.com""
What Verifiability Score of 1 Would Likely Indicate:
A perfect score would require all verifiability sub-metrics to be optimal, including but not limited to:
Being on a trusted provider list
Complete author/publisher/source metadata
Retrievable licenses
Proper signing
Full provenance documentation
