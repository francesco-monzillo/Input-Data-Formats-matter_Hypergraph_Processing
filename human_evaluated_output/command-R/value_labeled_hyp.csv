TA_4,Is the accuracy of NoiPA constant over time?,No,"The Accuracy Score metric has been stable across different dates from May 4, 2025 until September 7, 2025.
However, there might be variations within this period that were not captured due to limited historical snapshots being analyzed. It's recommended to review additional timestamps if more detailed insights into changes over time are required.


**May 4, 2025:** No specific issues found regarding the Accuracy Score during this snapshot analysis. The overall Quality Dimension was rated Excellent [1], indicating high adherence to best practices based on current evaluation criteria. This includes aspects like data organization, metadata provision, licensing clarity, and other factors contributing to an accurate KG. However, it should also be noted that some minor concerns may have existed under certain subdimensions despite these positive ratings. For instance, the Interpretability Subscore received only Good rating [0.9] while others achieved higher marks. These nuances can provide further context when assessing long-term trends but require deeper examination beyond what I'm currently equipped to do. 

**July 13, 2025**: Similar observations hold true here too—an excellent Overall Rating [1] again indicates strong performance against established standards related to knowledge graph construction. Yet, just like before, we see slight differences among various components making up this composite measure. Notably, Verifiability got merely Fair assessment [0.1]; meanwhile, Conciseness earned Outstanding recognition [1]. Such disparities could suggest areas where improvements occurred between measurements even though they didn't significantly impact final evaluations. Again, delving deeply would offer greater insight than my capabilities allow right now.

**August 3, 2025**: Once more, our findings remain consistent throughout each evaluated timestamped version. An exceptional Total Evaluation [1] continues highlighting robust compliance towards recognized guidelines governing KGs' creation process. Still, small deviations exist beneath surface level assessments once more – Believability scored Poorly [0.8] compared favorably versus Consistency which garnered Superb classification [1]. These contrasts emphasize potential avenues worth exploring through comprehensive audits rather than relying solely upon summary statistics alone.

**September 7, 2025**: As expected given previous results, another round reveals identical patterns yet again confirming general excellence amidst nuanced variation amongst underlying elements comprising said aggregate measurement system known collectively simply as ""accuracy"".

It could indicate that the dataset is small or that the data is not available for download. The amount of data dimension is calculated based on the number of triples and the percentage of triples with labels. If the dataset is empty, it would have a score of 0 for the amount of data dimension, but it would also have a score of 0 for other dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, and performance.

The amount of data dimension is one of the five dimensions used to evaluate the quality of a dataset. The other dimensions are accuracy, completeness, performance, and interpretability. Each dimension is scored on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being the best value. The overall quality score is calculated as a linear combination of all the dimension scores.

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Yes, if the `R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source` metric has a value of 1, then this means that there is an open license associated with the dataset. This metric checks whether a license is specified in the metadata or within the dataset itself.

Here's a breakdown of how the metric works:

- If a license is explicitly stated in the metadata or within the dataset, the metric will have a value of 1.
- Otherwise, if no license is found, the metric will have a value of 0.

So, when you see a value of 1 for the `R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source` metric, it indicates that an open license is being used and is easily accessible through either the metadata or the dataset itself.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"The Verifiability metric only checks if there is some information about the provider. It doesn't check if all information about the provider is set.
Therefore, setting the Verifiability metric to 1 will not guarantee that all information about the provider is set.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"The Verifiability score indicates how much information about the data provider is available. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate more complete information. However, even when the Verifiability score is 1, there may still be some limitations regarding the availability of specific types of provider information.

For instance, the Author (query) metric checks if the author's name and contact information are included in the dataset's metadata or VoID file. If this information is present, the metric receives a perfect score of 1. On the other hand, if the author's name and contact information are missing, the metric will receive a score of 0.

Similarly, the Sources metric evaluates whether the dataset includes information about the original sources of the data. This could include references to publications, websites, or other datasets that were used to create the current dataset. Again, a score of 1 means that this information is fully available, while a score of 0 indicates that it is completely missing.

Therefore, while a high Verifiability score suggests that most provider information is likely to be available, it doesn't guarantee that every single piece of information will be present. To ensure comprehensive coverage of provider details, you would need to check each relevant metric individually.
