IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"The accuracy of WordNet cannot be determined based on the available information. However, according to one study, WordNet's coverage of English words is estimated to be around 70%. This means that approximately 70% of English words are included in the WordNet database.

It's important to note that this estimate may vary depending on the specific version of WordNet being used and the criteria for evaluating word coverage. Additionally, WordNet's accuracy can also depend on factors such as the context in which it is being used and the specific task it is applied to. Therefore, while the overall accuracy of WordNet might not be precisely quantifiable, it remains a valuable resource for various natural language processing tasks due to its extensive coverage of English vocabulary and semantic relationships.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,

TA_3,Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?,"No, it is discontinuous","The most recent version of this knowledge graph was released on September 7, 2023. The KG has been regularly updating its content monthly until August 3rd, but there have only been two releases so far – one each month between July and September.

Therefore, while we cannot guarantee absolute freshness due to potential delays during processing cycles, you can expect relatively current datasets when accessing them through appropriate channels like FTP servers provided by DBLS. However, please note that some resources may be unavailable depending on your chosen method of retrieval. For instance, querying endpoints might yield different results compared to downloading files directly using URLs listed under ""URLs for Download"" within our documentation section. 

If real-time accuracy matters significantly more than timeliness regarding certain use cases involving these KGs, consider exploring alternative options offering streaming capabilities instead. This approach ensures immediate reflection upon changes made upstream rather than relying solely on periodic batch processes which could introduce lag times varying based on various factors including server load conditions among others.

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for the amount of data does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. It could indicate that the dataset is small or that the data is not available for analysis. The amount of data score is calculated based on the number of triples and the percentage of triples with labels. If the dataset has a low number of triples or a low percentage of triples with labels, it may result in a low amount of data score.

To determine if a dataset is empty, you can check the number of triples and the percentage of triples with labels. If both values are zero, it indicates that the dataset is empty. However, if only one of the values is zero, it suggests that the dataset is not empty but may have a low amount of data or incomplete information.

E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","It's possible that a dataset has an Amount of Data Score of 0 even though there may still be some data within the dataset. This could occur due to various reasons, such as issues with the SPARQL endpoint, incorrect data retrieval methods, or other technical challenges.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"The verifiability metric only considers whether the dataset's provider is listed among those considered trustworthy. It doesn't require additional information about the provider.

Therefore, setting verifiability to 1 would indicate that the dataset comes from a trusted source but wouldn't guarantee comprehensive information about the provider.
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"The Verifiability score indicates how much information about the data provider is available. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate more comprehensive information about the data provider. However, even when the Verifiability score is 1, there may still be some limitations regarding the availability of specific types of provider information.

For instance, the Author (query) metric assesses whether the author's name and contact information are included in the dataset's metadata or SPARQL endpoint. If this information is present, the metric receives a perfect score of 1. On the other hand, if the author's name and contact information are unavailable, the metric will receive a score of 0.

Similarly, the Contributor (query) metric evaluates the presence of contributor names and contact information in the dataset's metadata or SPARQL endpoint. Again, a score of 1 is assigned if this information is readily available, while a score of 0 is given if it is missing.

Therefore, while a Verifiability score of 1 suggests that most provider information is likely to be available, it doesn't guarantee that every single piece of provider information will be present. Some aspects, like the author's and contributor's names and contact details, might still be missing despite a high Verifiability score.
