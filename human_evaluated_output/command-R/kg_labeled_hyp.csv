E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","No, a score of 0 for the amount of data dimension does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. The amount of data dimension is calculated based on the number of triples, the number of labels or comments, and the percentage of triples with labels. If a dataset has a low number of triples, a low number of labels or comments, or a low percentage of triples with labels, it may result in a low score for the amount of data dimension.

It's important to note that the amount of data dimension is just one aspect of the overall quality assessment, and a low score in this dimension does not necessarily indicate that the dataset is of poor quality overall. It's essential to consider the scores in other dimensions, such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency, to get a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's quality.",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","It's possible that a dataset has an Amount-of-Data Score of 0 even though there may still be some data within the dataset. This could occur due to various reasons, such as issues with data retrieval, incomplete data, or other factors affecting the evaluation process.

To confirm if a dataset truly lacks data, you should examine additional metrics like the Number of Entities Counted with Regex, Number of Triples (Query), and Number of Labels/Comments Present on the Data. These metrics provide more specific insights into the presence and quantity of data within the dataset. If these metrics also indicate zero or very low counts, then it's likely that the dataset indeed contains little to no usable data.
