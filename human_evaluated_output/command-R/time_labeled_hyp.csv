E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Yes, if the `license` metric has a value of 1, this indicates that the dataset uses an open license. This means that the dataset's license allows users to freely access, reuse, modify, and distribute the data without restrictions.

The `license` metric evaluates whether a dataset's license is easily accessible and retrievable from either the metadata or the dataset itself. It checks if the license is specified using a well-known identifier, such as a Creative Commons license or an Open Definition License. If the license is clearly stated and meets these criteria, the metric assigns a value of 1. Otherwise, it assigns a value of 0.

Therefore, when the `license` metric has a value of 1, it confirms that the dataset uses an open license, which enables unrestricted access, sharing, and modification of the data by users.

E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Yes, if the `License machine redeable` metric has a value of 1, then this indicates that the dataset uses an open license. This metric checks whether there is a license specified in the VoID description or within the dataset itself.

Here's a breakdown of how the `License machine redeable` metric works:

- **Input**: VoID file or metadata
- **Output**: String containing the license if it can be retrieved, or False if the license is not indicated
- **Dimension**: Licensing

The presence of an open license ensures that users have the right to reuse, modify, and distribute the data according to the terms outlined in the license. It promotes transparency and encourages collaboration by allowing others to build upon and improve the dataset.

For your specific datasets, you mentioned that they have a `License machine redeable` value of 1, which means they do provide an open license.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"The Verifiability metric measures how much information is known about the data provider. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate more information is known about the data provider. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that all information about the provider is set.

For instance, let's consider two datasets A and B. Dataset A has a Verifiability score of 1, while dataset B has a Verifiability score of 0.5. This means that we have more information about the data provider for dataset A compared to dataset B. Still, there might be some unknown aspects regarding the data provider for both datasets. For example, we may know the name and contact details of the data provider for dataset A but lack information about their location or other relevant details. Similarly, for dataset B, we could have partial knowledge, like knowing only the organization's name but lacking specific contact information.

Therefore, even when the Verifiability metric is set to 1, it doesn't guarantee that all information about the data provider is set. Instead, it indicates a high level of confidence in the data provider's authenticity based on the available information.
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"The Verifiability score indicates how much information about the data provider is available. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate more comprehensive information about the data provider. However, even when the Verifiability score is 1, there may still be some limitations regarding the availability of certain types of provider information.

For instance, the Author (query) metric assesses whether the author's name and contact information are included in the dataset's metadata. If this information is not provided, the Author (query) score will be lower, impacting the overall Verifiability score. Similarly, the Sources metric evaluates whether the data sources are clearly stated in the metadata. Incomplete or missing source information would result in a lower Sources score, affecting the final Verifiability score.

Therefore, while a Verifiability score of 1 suggests that most provider information is available, it doesn't guarantee that every aspect of provider information is fully disclosed. Some specific details might still be lacking, depending on the dataset and the evaluation criteria used.
