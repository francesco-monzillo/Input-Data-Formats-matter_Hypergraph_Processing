IR_4,Which is the accuracy score of WordNet?,0.00,"The Accuracy score for WordNet (w3c-wordnet) is 0.0 (reported as 0.000000 across the measured timestamps).
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"Short answer
- In the dataset-quality report you shared the automated ""Accuracy score"" for W3C WordNet is 0.0 (at all timestamps). That means the automated accuracy metric in that assessment produced no positive result for the accuracy dimension.
- Don’t take that single 0.0 as a definitive statement that WordNet is ""wrong"" — it reflects what the particular automated checks found (or did not find/apply). Other indicators in the same report (Believability = 0.80, Trust = 0.75) point to fairly strong provenance/metadata, whereas Consistency and Completeness metrics are 0.0 and Verifiability is ~0.33 — showing mixed automatic-quality signals.

What the report numbers mean (brief)
- Accuracy score (0.0): the tool’s aggregate accuracy metric (range 0–1) computed from internal accuracy checks. A 0 often means the checker found no evidence of correctness for the measured properties or the checks were not applicable/run for this dataset representation.
- Believability (0.80) and Trust (0.75): metadata/provenance and publisher information look reasonable (license present, metadata available) — this raises confidence that the source is reputable.
- Consistency / Completeness = 0.0 and low Verifiability (~0.33): automatic structural and content checks flagged little or no coverage according to those metrics (or could not compute them fully), suggesting you should inspect data-level quality manually or with targeted tests.

Context about WordNet itself (qualitative)
- Princeton WordNet (the resource behind W3C WordNet) is a long‑standing, manually curated lexical database widely used in NLP. For many general-English lexical tasks it is considered reliable.
- Known limitations (things to watch for):
  - Coverage: excellent for general vocabulary, limited for specialized domains, recent slang, many named entities, or highly domain‑specific senses.
  - Sense granularity: senses are often fine-grained; disambiguation can be tricky and may look like “errors” depending on your use case.
  - Outdated or culturally biased entries: as with any manual resource, some senses/usage notes may be dated or reflect annotator bias.
  - Conversion effects: the W3C RDF/OWL conversion can introduce mapping/serialization issues (blank nodes, property mapping, dropped annotations) that affect automated checks.
- Many users find WordNet “accurate enough” for tasks such as synonym expansion, semantic relatedness, baseline WSD, but for high‑precision applications (medical, legal, safety‑critical) you should validate against a domain gold standard.

How to get a practical, reliable answer for your use case
1. Define ""accuracy"" for your purpose:
   - Exact correctness of synonym sets? (precision)
   - Correct hypernym/hyponym links? (precision/recall)
   - Usefulness in downstream tasks (WSD, information retrieval)?
2. Do a targeted evaluation:
   - Random sample: manually evaluate a random sample of synsets/triples (e.g., 100–500 items) and compute precision.
   - Task-based test: measure WordNet’s contribution to your real task (e.g., effect on retrieval or classification).
   - Automated consistency checks: run SPARQL queries that look for obvious problems (missing labels, duplicate senses, invalid datatype usage).
3. Check conversion fidelity:
   - Compare the RDF version against the canonical Princeton distribution (tools or direct mapping) to spot mapping or data-loss issues.
4. Use external validation:
   - Compare WordNet relations to other lexical resources (e.g., BabelNet, Wikidata) for spot-checks.

If you want, I can
- Explain a compact evaluation plan (sample size, sampling method, scoring rubric) tied to your tolerance for error.
- Produce SPARQL queries you can run against the W3C WordNet RDF endpoint to spot-check common problems (e.g., sample synsets, list synonyms and glosses, detect missing labels).
- Run a small manual-style check if you tell me which aspects you care about (synonyms vs. hypernyms vs. gloss accuracy vs. coverage in a domain).

IR_5,What is the trust value of the Linked Open Camera dataset?,0.5,"The trust value for the Linked Open Camera dataset (bpr) is 0.500000 — i.e. 0.50 (50%). The same value is reported across timestamps (latest: 2025-09-07).
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
IR_5,How trustworthy is the Linked Open Camera dataset?,0.5,"Short answer: moderately trustworthy.

Summary (key metrics)
- Overall trust value: 0.50 (moderate).
- Strong points: security = 1.00, accuracy = 1.00, metadata availability (A1 / R1.1 / R1.2 / F4) = 1.00, RDF dump(s) available and dataset registered in search engines, SPARQL endpoint available (http://dati.camera.it/sparql), downloadable RDF dumps listed, number of triples ≈ 366,800.
- Weak points: verifiability = 0.11 (low), interlinking score / interlinking completeness = 0.0 (no or negligible external linking), URI dereferenceability F1-D ≈ 0.0, reputation score ≈ 0.000008 (very low).

What that means in practice
- You can rely on the dataset for internal or experimental analyses where data completeness and provenance linking to other LOD sources are not critical. Its security/accuracy/metadata practices are good (clear license and publisher info, downloadable RDF, SPARQL access).
- You should be cautious when using it as an authoritative source for integration or inference across the Linked Open Data cloud: the dataset has poor interlinking and limited verifiability (few external references, weak provenance evidence). Automated dereferencing of resource URIs is also measured as poor.

Practical recommendations
- If you plan to use it in a pipeline that merges data from multiple LOD sources, add validation steps (verify key facts against an independent source) and treat entities as lower-confidence unless you can add provenance.
- If you control the dataset or can suggest improvements, the highest-impact fixes to raise trust are:
  - add explicit provenance and contributor metadata (improve verifiability);
  - increase interlinking to external vocabularies/datasets (owl:sameAs, schema links) to raise interlinking score;
  - ensure URIs are dereferenceable (improve F1-D) and provide VoID or richer dataset-level metadata;
  - surface evidence about data creation/update processes and authoritative sources to raise reputation.
- For sensitive or high-stakes decisions, prefer datasets with higher verifiability/interlinking or corroborate bpr data with other authoritative sources.

If you want, I can:
- fetch and show the dataset’s license/publisher metadata and dump links,
- check a few sample entities to illustrate dereferenceability and interlinking,
- suggest an automated validation checklist tailored to your use case.

TA_1,Is the number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint always the same?,"No, they slightly increase over time.","No — the number of triples returned by the NoiPA SPARQL endpoint changes over time (it has been increasing). Measured values (Number of triples (query)):

- 2025-05-04: 412,894,535  
- 2025-07-13: 432,861,574  
- 2025-08-03: 439,796,613  
- 2025-09-07: 446,170,057

Overall increase from 2025-05-04 to 2025-09-07: +33,275,522 triples (≈ +8.06%). The dataset shows update history, so growth is expected. Note: the metadata-reported triple count (Number of triples (metadata)) is a different measurement (340,000,000) and remains constant in the records.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_1,The number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint is constant?,"No, they slightly increase over time.","No — the count retrieved from the SPARQL endpoint is not constant. Measured ""Number of triples (query)"" values:

- 2025-05-04: 412,894,535  
- 2025-07-13: 432,861,574  
- 2025-08-03: 439,796,613  
- 2025-09-07: 446,170,057

So between 2025-05-04 and 2025-09-07 the dataset grew by 33,275,522 triples (≈ +8.1%).

Note: the metadata-reported value ""Number of triples (metadata)"" is 340,000,000 for all timestamps — that appears to be a static/metadata figure and does not reflect the endpoint's live counts.

Possible reasons for the discrepancy / change
- The KG is being updated (new data added).  
- Different counting sources: live SPARQL COUNT versus a static VoID/metadata value.  
- Counting scope differences (default graph vs named graphs, inference, duplicates, blank nodes, etc.).

If you want to monitor reliably, run a consistent SPARQL count (and record timestamp), for example:
SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?triples) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }

Also consider:
- Counting per graph if the endpoint uses named graphs (COUNT in FROM <graph>),  
- Using DISTINCT if you suspect duplicated triples,  
- Recording the query and time to ensure comparability.

If you want, I can:
- produce the exact percentage increases per interval, or  
- give a ready script (bash/Python) to poll the endpoint and log counts. Which would you prefer?
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_2,Is the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP always available?,Yes,"Short answer: No — you can't guarantee ""always"", but DBLP's SPARQL endpoint has been consistently reachable in the monitored checks.

Details from the monitoring data you supplied
- Endpoint URL: https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql
- Monitored availability: shown as ""Available"" on 2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03 and 2025-09-07.
- Availability scores recorded: 0.975 (May 2025) and 1.0 (July/Aug/Sept 2025) — i.e. very high availability in those checks.
- Availability for download:
  - RDF dump (metadata): available (metadata indicates downloadable dumps).
  - RDF dump (query): False — the SPARQL endpoint does not appear to expose a downloadable dump via query.
- Downloadable dump links recorded: https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz
- Authentication: not required.
- Endpoint protocol: HTTPS URL is used (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql).
- Notes: an ""Inactive links"" flag appears True in one of the 2025-09-07 records (this refers to some linked resources, not necessarily endpoint availability).

What this means in practice
- The DBLP SPARQL endpoint has been reliable in the sampled checks and metadata — but ""always available"" is an absolute you cannot safely promise for any public web service.
- For production use, assume occasional outages or maintenance windows can occur.

Recommended precautions
- If you need high reliability:
  - Use the RDF dump(s) (the URLs above) and host a local copy/mirror.
  - Implement retry/backoff and caching in your client.
  - Monitor the endpoint (simple uptime checks or a lightweight synthetic query) and fail over to the local dump when the endpoint is down.
  - Respect usage limits and polite query patterns to avoid rate-limiting.

If you want, I can:
- Give a short monitoring script (cURL/Python) to periodically check the endpoint and alert on failures.
- Show example SPARQL queries that are safe/polite to run against the DBLP endpoint.
",1,0,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_2,Is the DBLP SPARQL endpoint always up?,Yes,"Short answer: No — it’s not guaranteed to be ""always up"", but recent checks show it has been available most of the time.

What the collected checks show
- The endpoint URL https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql was reported as ""Available"" on multiple checks (2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03 and 2025-09-07).  
- Measured availability score ~0.975 (high but not 100%).  
- Typical observed latency is low (~0.1–0.2 s) and throughput in our checks ~6–8 req/s.  
- On 2025-09-07 an ""Inactive links"" flag was raised (some linked resources may be broken), but the SPARQL endpoint itself was still reachable that day.  
- There are RDF dumps you can use if the endpoint is down:
  - https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples
  - https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz

Recommendation
- If you need robust continuous access, do one or more of:
  - Use the RDF dump(s) locally (best for heavy/critical workloads).
  - Implement simple monitoring (HTTP HEAD or a lightweight ASK query) and alerting to detect outages quickly.
  - Cache query results or run a local triple store fed from the dump for production use.

Quick checks you can run
- HTTP HEAD:
  curl -I https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql
- Simple SPARQL ASK via POST:
  curl -s -H ""Content-Type: application/sparql-query"" --data 'ASK { ?s ?p ?o }' https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql

If you want, I can give a short script to monitor the endpoint and alert you (e.g., via email or Slack) when it becomes unavailable.

TA_3,Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always set to 1 in the observed period?,"No, it is discontinuous","Short answer: No.

Details — observed values for ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" on the Allie dataset in the records you provided:
- 2025-05-04 → 1.000000
- 2025-06-01 → 1.000000
- 2025-07-13 → 1.000000
- 2025-08-03 → 1.000000
- 2025-09-07 → 0.000000

So the dump flag was set to 1 for May–August 2025, but at the 2025-09-07 observation it is 0. If you want, I can (a) extract the full timeline of related fields (offline dumps, download URLs, availability queries) to help diagnose why it flipped, or (b) show all entries for the 2025-09-07 snapshot.

TA_3,Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?,"No, it is discontinuous","Short answer: No — the dump is not reliably ""always up.""

Evidence from the checks you provided
- There are offline dump URLs published (examples found in the metadata):
  - ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz
  - ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/
- A SPARQL endpoint is also advertised: http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql
- But automated checks frequently report:
  - ""Availability for download (query)"" = False (multiple timestamps), and in some checks the availability metadata flips between present and absent.
  - ""Inactive links"" flagged True in some runs.
  - Availability score ≈ 0.73–0.745 (not 1.0), indicating partial availability.
  - Monthly update frequency is reported, but recent checks still show intermittent unavailability.
- Metadata shows the dataset URL: http://allie.dbcls.jp/ and contact/source: Database Center for Life Science (info AT dbcls.rois.ac.jp).

What that means
- The maintainers do provide dumps (FTP) and a SPARQL endpoint, but monitoring results show intermittent failures (links inactive or downloads not reachable at check time). So the dump cannot be assumed to be continuously available 24/7 without occasional downtime.

Practical suggestions
- If you need reliable access:
  - Download and mirror the FTP dump (ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz) on a regular schedule (e.g., daily or weekly) and keep a local copy.
  - Use the SPARQL endpoint for ad-hoc queries when available (http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql), but plan fallbacks if it becomes unavailable.
  - Monitor availability (simple script checking FTP + endpoint) and alert on failures.
  - If downtime persists contact the provider: info AT dbcls.rois.ac.jp, or check http://allie.dbcls.jp/ for announcements.

If you want, I can:
- Try the FTP/SPARQL endpoints now (if you want me to attempt live checks),
- Draft a short script to periodically download and verify the dump, or
- Provide commands to download and mirror the gzip dump.

",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_4,Does the accuracy of NoiPA remain consistent over time?,No,"Short answer: Yes — the accuracy is effectively unchanged.

Details:
- Recorded accuracy values for NoiPA:
  - 2025-05-04: 0.999700 (99.9700%)
  - 2025-07-13: 0.999660 (99.9660%)
  - 2025-08-03: 0.999660 (99.9660%)
  - 2025-09-07: 0.999660 (99.9660%)

- Summary statistics:
  - Mean = 0.999670 (≈ 99.9670%)
  - Standard deviation ≈ 0.000017 (≈ 0.0017 percentage points)
  - Max change from first to last = −0.000040 (~ −0.004%)

Interpretation: the accuracy stays essentially constant (≈99.967%), with only a tiny drop of 0.00004 between May and July that is negligible and likely within measurement/rounding noise.

TA_5,What is the longest continuous period in which the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset data dump has been equals to 1?,91 days,"The longest continuous period was from 2025-05-04 through 2025-08-03 (Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1), a span of 91 days.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_5,"For how long, without interruption, has the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset data dump remained up?",91 days,"Short answer: I can’t tell — the supplied metadata does not include an uptime / continuous-availability metric, so you cannot determine “time up without interruption” from these fields.

What I checked in the metadata
- There are indicators showing the dataset is available:
  - Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = True
  - Availability for download (metadata) = 1
  - Offline dump URLs listed: ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz and ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/
  - SPARQL endpoint URL: http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql
- There are availability scores (e.g. Availability score ≈ 0.70–0.74) recorded at various timestamps — these are historical quality/availability indicators, not a continuous uptime duration.
- No field says “current continuous uptime”, “time since last downtime”, or similar.

If you need to obtain the uninterrupted-up time, options
1. Immediate check (one-off)
   - Test the endpoint/dump now to see if it is reachable:
     - SPARQL endpoint: curl -I http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql
     - FTP dump: curl -I ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz
   - That only gives current reachability, not continuous uptime.

2. Determine historical uninterrupted uptime
   - Ask the dataset publisher/host (Database Center for Life Science / ftp.dbcls.jp) for server logs or monitoring reports that record downtimes.
   - If they keep access logs (HTTP/FTP) you can derive periods of downtime from those logs.

3. Start continuous monitoring (recommended)
   - Use an uptime monitoring service (UptimeRobot, Pingdom, StatusCake) to monitor:
     - HTTP(S) GET on the SPARQL endpoint or an index page
     - FTP accessibility for the dump file
   - Configure checks (e.g., 1–5 minute intervals). The monitor will report current continuous uptime and time since last downtime.

4. Quick self-monitoring script (example)
   - Run a simple cron / loop that pings the endpoint and records status; when you want current continuous uptime you can compute the time since the last failure. Example (bash pseudocode):
     while true; do
       if curl -sfS http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql >/dev/null; then
         echo ""$(date --iso-8601=seconds) UP"" >> /var/log/allie-uptime.log
       else
         echo ""$(date --iso-8601=seconds) DOWN"" >> /var/log/allie-uptime.log
       fi
       sleep 60
     done

If you want, I can:
- Provide ready-to-run monitoring scripts (more complete, with downtime detection and continuous-up calculation), or
- Draft an email template you can send to the dataset host requesting uptime logs / “time since last outage” information. Which would you prefer?

Evidence and examples (all measures timestamped 2025-09-07 in the data):
- Availability / metadata accessibility
  - “Availability for download (metadata)” = 1.00 for several datasets (CIDOC‑CRM, bpr, w3c‑wordnet).
  - “Availability of RDF dump (metadata)” = 1.00 (bpr, CIDOC‑CRM, w3c‑wordnet, dblp‑kg).
  - F2a / F4 metadata checks (metadata available via standard primary sources / registered in searchable engines) = 1.00 for multiple KGs.
- Security / access
  - “A1.2 Authentication & HTTPS support” = 1.00 for bpr (and present as satisfied for other KGs).
  - Security score = 1.00 for bpr at 2025‑09‑07.
- Performance (dataset-level)
  - Some KGs report top performance: dblp‑kg and NoiPA have “Performance score” = 1.00 (2025‑09‑07). Other KGs have low/zero performance, so this is dataset-dependent.
- Other high individual indicators
  - DOI / persistent identifier support: CIDOC‑CRM shows F3 (data referable via DOI) = 1.00.
  - URI dereferenceability / availability checks are satisfied for several KGs (e.g., dblp‑kg shows URIs dereferenceability = 1.00).

Important caveats
- Scores are heterogeneous across KGs: a dimension can be excellent for some datasets and poor for others (e.g., Performance is 1.0 for dblp‑kg/NoiPA but 0.0 for other KGs).
- Some dimensions (Currency, Interlinking, Interpretability, many consistency/quality metrics) are low or zero across many datasets in September 2025.
- Different metrics use different scales (some aggregate FAIR/Normalized scores are >1), so compare per-metric semantics rather than raw numbers across different dimensions.

If you want, I can:
- produce a ranked list of dimensions by average or median value across all datasets for 2025‑09‑07, or
- list, per dataset, which dimensions are high vs low in that month. Which would you prefer?

- Best‑performing dimensions overall
  - Interpretability — consistently high for several KGs (examples: bpr Interpretability 0.9979; NoiPA Interpretability 1.00).  
  - Security — frequently top-rated (examples: bpr Security 1.00; environment‑agency Security 1.00; dblp‑kg 0.50).  
  - Conciseness / Representational consistency — generally strong in multiple datasets (examples: bpr Conciseness 0.884; bpr Representational‑Consistency 0.876; NoiPA Conciseness 0.991).  
  - Availability (metadata/dumps/search registration) — good for some KGs (dblp‑kg Availability 1.00; CIDOC‑CRM and some others ~0.50), so moderate-to-high overall.

- Weak/low dimensions
  - Interlinking — very low in many datasets (bpr Interlinking ≈ 0.00001; Interlinking completeness often 0).  
  - Some FAIR/currency metrics are uneven: a few datasets score 1.0 on Currency but several have 0, so Currency is mixed overall.  
  - Licensing and Verifiability are mostly moderate (many ~0.5 or lower).

E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The Availability score is 1 because, at the time(s) the score was computed, DBLP satisfied all the availability checks used to compute that dimension. The availability dimension is a linear combination of several availability metrics, and DBLP had the primary ones set to the “available”/full value. Key facts from the measurements:

- Working access points
  - A1-D Working access point(s) = 1.0 (2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03, 2025-09-07)
  - SPARQL endpoint reported as Available, SPARQL endpoint URL = https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql

- Download / dump availability (metadata)
  - Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.0 (2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03, 2025-09-07)
  - URL for download the dataset present: ['https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples', 'https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz'] (provided in multiple timestamps)

- Metadata & registration
  - A1-M / F2a-M / F4-M metadata checks = 1.0 (metadata available via primary sources, registered in search engines, metadata indexed)
  - License machine/human readable present (R1.1 = 1.0; license links such as https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

- Transport / security
  - A1.2 Authentication & HTTPS support = 1.0
  - Availability of a common accepted media type = True (metadata-media-type entries present)

Because these core availability signals were all true/maximum, the aggregated Availability score was computed as 1.0.

(If you see the availability score change later — e.g. to 0.75 on 2025-09-07 — that reflects a later re-evaluation where one or more availability sub-metrics changed; you can compare the same sub-metrics at that later timestamp to see which item dropped.)

E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"The availability score is 1.0 because the DBLP KG exposes the required, working access points and metadata that the availability metric checks. Concretely (examples from the recorded measures):

- A1-D Working access point(s) = 1.0 — there is an operational access point.
- SPARQL endpoint = Available, SPARQL endpoint URL = https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql.
- Availability for download (metadata) = 1.0 and Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.0 — the dataset metadata lists downloadable RDF files.
- URL for download the dataset includes explicit links (e.g. https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz).
- A2-M Registered in search engines = 1.0 and A1.2 Authentication & HTTPS support = 1.0 — the dataset is discoverable and supports HTTPS.

Note: some lower-level checks (e.g. ""Availability for download (query)"" — whether an RDF dump can be retrieved via a particular SPARQL query) are false, but the availability score is driven by the presence of working access points and downloadable resources reported in the metadata. Those positive metadata/access-point checks are what make the overall availability score equal to 1.0.

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Short answer: Not necessarily.

What a 0 amount-of-data score can mean
- It can mean the dataset truly contains no triples (empty).
- More commonly it means the amount-of-data metrics used by the evaluator produced zero usable evidence — e.g. no triple counts were found in metadata, the SPARQL endpoint was unreachable, or the automatic checks returned no measurable data. In other words, “0” often means “no measurable data found,” not strictly “file is empty.”

How to tell which is the case (quick checks)
1. Check the evaluator’s raw metrics:
   - Number of triples (metadata)
   - Number of triples (query)
   - Number of entities
   - Number of labels/comments present on the data
   If any of these show nonzero values, the dataset is not empty and the 0 score is likely due to how the score was computed/normalized.

2. Try a direct SPARQL count (if endpoint available):
   SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?triples) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }
   - If this returns >0, the dataset has triples.

3. Check for an RDF dump or VoID metadata:
   - Look for void:triples or other metadata that reports triple counts.
   - If an RDF dump exists, you can count triples locally (e.g., wc -l on an N-Triples file, or use a parser that counts triples).

4. Check accessibility:
   - Is there a working SPARQL endpoint or downloadable RDF? If not, the evaluator may not have been able to measure amount-of-data and returned 0.

5. Check logs or detailed evaluator output:
   - Many evaluation tools record why a metric couldn’t be computed (timeouts, missing fields, permission errors).

Why you might get 0 even when data exists
- Missing or absent metadata (VoID/DCAT).
- SPARQL endpoint requires authentication, is offline, or blocked.
- Evaluator thresholds/normalization: very small datasets may score 0 after normalization/rounding.
- The evaluator counts only certain entity types or excludes blank nodes, so perceived “amount” can be 0.

Recommended next steps
- Run the SPARQL count above (or inspect the RDF dump) to confirm whether triples exist.
- If triples exist but the score is 0, add/repair metadata (VoID or dcat) and ensure the endpoint/dump is accessible, then re-run the evaluation.
- If the dataset is actually empty, populate it with data or update metadata to avoid misleading evaluations.

If you want, tell me which dataset label from your list you care about and I can point to the specific metric lines to check and suggest the exact command or SPARQL query to run.

E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Short answer: No — a 0 amount-of-data score does not always mean the dataset contains no data. It means the measurement found no (or effectively no) measurable data according to the metrics and thresholds used — which can happen for several reasons.

What a 0 can indicate
- The dataset truly has zero triples/entities (empty).
- The dataset has data, but it was not accessible to the measurement (SPARQL endpoint down, dump missing, access blocked).
- The measurement failed (queries returned errors) or required metadata (VoID) was absent, and missing values were treated as zeros.
- The dataset contains very few triples relative to the normalization/thresholds used, and after aggregation/normalization the score rounds to 0.

How to check which is the case
1. Look at the underlying metrics (these are typically available in the measurement output):
   - Number of triples (query) and Number of triples (metadata)
   - Number of entities
   - Availability for download / Availability of RDF dump
   - Presence of a working SPARQL endpoint
   - Number of labels/comments present
   If those raw counts are > 0, the dataset has data but the scoring pipeline may have treated other missing metrics as zeros.
2. Try a simple SPARQL count against the endpoint (if available):
   SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?triples) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }
   and/or
   SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?s) AS ?entities) WHERE { ?s a ?type }
3. Check for an RDF dump/VoID file or dataset URL and open the dump to count triples locally (e.g., using rdfcat/rapper/riot).
4. Inspect any ""None"" or error values in the measurement output — these indicate failed/missing checks.

What to do if you operate the dataset
- Publish VoID/DCAT metadata including triple count if possible.
- Provide an RDF dump or enable/repair the SPARQL endpoint.
- Ensure the dataset is discoverable (registered in search engines) and has rdfs:label usage if you want better scores.

If you share the dataset label or the raw metrics you have (Number of triples (metadata/query), SPARQL endpoint URL, or dump URL), I can check the likely cause and suggest exact steps.

E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Short answer: Not necessarily. A dataset availability score of 1 means the dataset met all the availability sub‑metrics used in this scoring model — but that does not always require both a working SPARQL endpoint and a downloadable RDF dump simultaneously. It means the combination of availability checks (working access points, metadata about dumps, registered metadata, download links, etc.) are all satisfied.

What to check to know exactly what is working
- A1‑D (Working access point(s)) — indicates an operational access point (SPARQL or accessible dump).
- Availability of RDF dump (query) and Availability for download (query) — indicate a working SPARQL endpoint (queryable).
- Availability of RDF dump (metadata) and Availability for download (metadata) — indicate that a downloadable dump is published and discoverable in metadata (VoID/DCAT).
- SPARQL endpoint URL and URL for download the dataset — concrete evidence of each access method.

How to verify in practice
- Try the SPARQL endpoint URL (a simple ASK or SELECT 1 LIMIT 1).
- Follow the download URL(s) from the dataset metadata and try to fetch the dump file(s).
- Inspect the metadata (VoID/DCAT) for dump URLs and media types.

E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"Short answer: not necessarily.

An overall ""Availability score = 1"" means the dataset scored maximum on the availability sub-metrics used by that evaluation system, but it does not by itself prove both a live SPARQL endpoint and a downloadable RDF dump are currently reachable from your client. The score is an aggregate; you must inspect the individual availability measures to know exactly which access points are present and verified.

What to check (quick checklist)
- Sparql endpoint: Look at the Sparql endpoint metric (or the SPARQL endpoint URL). Then test it:
  - Example quick test: ASK { ?s ?p ?o } against the endpoint (or run a simple SELECT with LIMIT 1) to confirm it answers.
  - Or from the shell: curl -I ""https://example.org/sparql"" to check HTTP status and headers; then run an actual query.
- RDF dump(s): Look for metadata fields like ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"", ""URL for download the dataset"" or ""Offline dumps"". If a URL is present, test it:
  - curl -I <dump-url> (check status, Content-Type)
  - curl -L <dump-url> | head -n 50 (confirm content begins with RDF serialization)
- Distinguish metadata-only vs runtime checks: some systems award availability points for documented/downloadable dumps (metadata) even if the tool did not actively download them. Verify actual downloadability.
- Authentication & HTTPS: check the ""Requires authentication"" and ""Use HTTPS"" / ""A1.2 Authentication & HTTPS support"" metrics. A score of 1 can hide access restrictions if authentication is required.
- Freshness / staleness: an availability score is a snapshot in time. Re-run the checks if you need current guarantees.

Example commands
- Test SPARQL endpoint liveness:
  - curl -G --data-urlencode 'query=ASK { ?s ?p ?o }' ""https://example.org/sparql"" -H ""Accept: application/sparql-results+json""
- Check dump URL header:
  - curl -I ""https://example.org/dumps/wordnet.rdf.gz""
- Try a small portion of the dump:
  - curl -L ""https://example.org/dumps/wordnet.nt.gz"" | gunzip | head -n 200

Conclusion
- Use the Availability score as a quick indicator, but confirm by inspecting the individual availability metrics and by performing the live checks above to be certain both the SPARQL endpoint and RDF dump are actually up and reachable.

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Short answer: No. A value of 1 for the license metric means a license was explicitly indicated and retrievable from the primary metadata/source — it does not by itself mean the license is ""open"".

What it does mean
- 1 = a human- or machine-readable license statement was found (the dataset reports some license).
- 0 = no license statement was found.

How to tell whether the reported license is open
1. Inspect the reported license identifier or text (the metric often returns a URI such as a Creative Commons URL, an Open Definition URI, an SPDX id, or a textual statement).
2. Compare it to an authoritative list of open licences:
   - Open Definition / Open Knowledge Foundation approved licences (e.g. CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA) — generally considered open.
   - SPDX/OSI lists (Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD, etc.) — open.
   - Licences with NC (non-commercial) or ND (no derivatives) are not considered open under the Open Definition.
   - “All rights reserved”, proprietary licences, or restrictive custom licences are not open.
3. If the metadata gives a noncanonical or human text (e.g. “see website”), fetch the legal text or an SPDX/OpenDefinition mapping to be sure.

Examples
- http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ (CC0) → open
- http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by → open (CC-BY)
- https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 → open
- https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ → not open (NC)
- “All rights reserved” → not open

Practical tips
- Prefer machine-readable license URIs (rdfs:license, dcterms:license) so you can automatically map to SPDX/OpenDefinition.
- If you want, paste a dataset’s reported license URI or the metric output here and I can check whether that license is open and explain any caveats.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Short answer: No.

A value of 1 for the R1.1 (or ""license reported"") metric only means a license was found and is retrievable (machine- or human-readable). It does NOT by itself indicate that the license is an ""open"" license.

What to check to decide whether the license is open
- Inspect the license identifier/URI that was retrieved (e.g. a Creative Commons URL, SPDX id, Apache/MIT URL, ODbL, etc.).
- Compare that identifier against an authoritative list of open licenses (Open Definition / Open Knowledge Foundation, SPDX list of permissive/OS-licenses, Creative Commons, OSI-approved licenses).
- Beware of licenses that look similar but restrict use (e.g. CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND are not open under the Open Definition; CC BY-SA and CC BY are open).

Programmatic approach (high level)
1. If R1.1 == 1, extract the license URI/text from metadata.
2. Normalize to a canonical form (follow redirects, map obvious variants to canonical URIs or SPDX IDs).
3. Check against a whitelist of ""open"" license URIs/SPDX IDs (for example: CC0, CC BY-4.0, CC BY-3.0, CC BY-SA, Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD, ODbL — depending on your policy on share-alike).
4. If match → mark as open; otherwise treat as non-open or unknown and inspect manually.

Examples from your data (illustrates presence != openness)
- dblp-kg: license machine-readable = https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ → CC0 (open).
- micro-coronavirus: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ → CC BY 4.0 (open).
- bpr: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.it or opendefinition link to cc-by-sa → present (R1.1 = 1) — needs checking whether you consider CC BY-SA acceptable as ""open"" for your use.
- w3c-wordnet: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 → Apache 2.0 (open).
- CIDOC-CRM: R1.1 = 0 / license not retrieved → no license reported at all.

Recommendations
- Use canonical license identifiers (SPDX IDs or canonical CC/OSI URLs) in metadata to make automated checks reliable.
- Maintain a policy/list of which licenses you consider ""open"" (Open Definition–compliant vs. more liberal).
- If you need a binary ""open / not open"" for automation, implement the whitelist lookup above and fall back to manual review for unknowns.

If you want, I can:
- produce a short whitelist of common open-license URIs/SPDX IDs you can use,
- or provide a small script (Python/pseudocode) to fetch the license URI and check openness automatically. Which would you prefer?

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"Short answer: No — verifiability = 1 means the dataset scored perfectly against the verifiability metrics used by the assessment, not that every possible piece of provider information is necessarily present.

Explanation and caveats
- What verifiability = 1 typically signals
  - The dataset passed all the checks that compose the Verifiability score in the particular evaluation framework (for example: license is machine- and human-readable, metadata are available via standard sources (VoID/DCAT/SPARQL/searchable engine), publisher/author information is present where the metric requires it, metadata can be retrieved from primary sources, the dataset is signed if that was part of the metrics, etc.).
  - In short: the metadata and provenance evidence the tool expected were found and scored maximally.

- What verifiability = 1 does not automatically guarantee
  - That every single provider field (all contributor emails, every affiliation, every contact) is filled — only that the required fields for the metric are present.
  - That the provider is trustworthy or on any external ""trusted provider list"" (that is a separate metric/dimension: believability/trust).
  - That the metadata are correct or complete beyond the specific checks; high verifiability means the required metadata exist and are discoverable, not that they are error-free.

How to confirm provider information yourself
- Inspect the metadata (VoID/DCAT, dataset landing page) for dcterms:creator / dcterms:publisher / foaf:maker / prov:wasAttributedTo / schema:creator and for license (dcterms:license, dcterms:rights).
- If a SPARQL endpoint is available, run queries to extract these properties. Example generic SPARQL (adapt prefixes and endpoint as needed):

  SELECT DISTINCT ?prop ?value WHERE {
    { ?s a <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Dataset> . ?s ?prop ?value }
    UNION
    { ?s a <http://schema.org/Dataset> . ?s ?prop ?value }
    FILTER (?prop IN (dcterms:creator, dcterms:publisher, dcterms:contributor, dcterms:license,
                      foaf:maker, prov:wasAttributedTo, schema:creator, schema:publisher))
  }

- Check for a DOI or other persistent identifier (F3), and for machine-readable license statements (R1.1/R1.3).
- Check the separate “Is on a trusted provider list” / trust metrics if you need evidence the provider is recognized by third-party registries.

If you want, tell me which dataset or assessment report you’re looking at and I can point to exactly which provider-related checks passed or failed and which metadata fields you should inspect.
",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"Short answer: No — not automatically.

Explanation and guidance:
- The verifiability score is a composite (linear combination) of the specific verifiability metrics that the system checks. A value of 1 means the dataset achieved the best possible result for those particular checks at the time they were run.
- Whether that equals “all provider information is available” depends on which provider-related metrics are included and how they are weighted. If the metric set includes publisher, author, contact email, source URL, trusted-provider flag, license presence, DOI, etc., and all of those return positive, then the composite can be 1 and you can say the checked provider information is present.
- However, if some provider fields are not part of the metric set (or are considered optional), the score can be 1 even though some provider details are missing. Scores are also time-stamped, so the underlying metadata could change after the measurement.

What to check to be sure:
- Inspect the individual verifiability metrics rather than the aggregate. Look for measures such as: Author (metadata/query), Publisher, Contributor, Sources, R1.2 (publisher info), Is on a trusted provider list, License (human- and machine-readable), F3-M (DOI), Signed.
- Open the VoID/DCAT, dataset landing page or SPARQL endpoint and verify the actual fields (contact email, publisher name, license URL, DOI).
- Check timestamps of the measurement to ensure the result is current.

Recommendation: treat a verifiability score of 1 as a strong signal that the checked provider-related metadata passed the automated tests, but always confirm the concrete metadata fields you care about by inspecting the underlying measures or the dataset metadata itself.
