Evidence and verification pointers
- Machine-readable license URIs found in the dataset metadata/queries:
  - http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero
  - https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
- You can inspect/verify the license yourself on DBLP and in their RDF dump:

Notes / caveats
- Some automated checks did not find a human‑readable license statement exposed via the SPARQL endpoint (metadata shows the machine‑readable CC0 URIs but a human‑readable license field was not reported by the endpoint). If you need absolute legal certainty for re‑use, check the license statement in the DBLP site/downloaded RDF files or contact the DBLP maintainer (e.g. Marcel R. Ackermann as listed on dblp).

IR_4,Which is the accuracy score of WordNet?,0.00,"The Accuracy score for WordNet (w3c-wordnet) is 0.000000 (i.e., 0.0). This value appears on 2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03 and 2025-09-07.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
IR_4,How accurate is WordNet?,0.00,"Short answer: According to the automated quality report you pasted, the W3C WordNet RDF dataset's Accuracy score is 0.0 (measured at multiple timestamps in 2025). In other words, the automatic accuracy metric in that assessment reports no positive accuracy signal.

What that means (and doesn’t mean)
- The metric value 0.0 comes from the evaluation tool/benchmarks used in the report (the report also shows the metric’s definition: an overall accuracy score as a linear combination of sub-metrics). A 0.0 means the automatic checks used by that tool did not find/assign any accuracy credit.
- It does NOT necessarily prove that WordNet’s lexical content is “wrong.” It can instead indicate one of these situations:
  - The automated accuracy tests require a ground truth or particular checks that were not available or applicable for this RDF representation.
  - The tool could not evaluate the necessary sub-metrics (missing metadata, unavailable endpoints, or incompatible representation).
  - Real factual/lexical problems could exist — but the score alone doesn’t locate or explain them.

Other related quality signals in the same report
- Verifiability ≈ 0.332 (moderate): some metadata/source info exists but not complete.
- Believability = 0.80 and Trust ≈ 0.75: the dataset is considered reasonably trustworthy by the tool’s heuristics.
- Interlinking / Number of triples linked = 0.0: it’s not linked out much, which can affect automated cross-checking.
- Availability / FAIR-related metrics are mixed (some FAIR checks pass, some metadata flags present).
- Metadata: dataset URL = http://www.w3.org/TR/wordnet-rdf (useful for manual checking).

How to get a meaningful accuracy assessment (recommended next steps)
1. Clarify scope
   - Do you mean the Princeton WordNet lexical resource in general, or specifically the W3C RDF conversion (WordNet 2.0 (W3C) at http://www.w3.org/TR/wordnet-rdf)?
2. Inspect sample data
   - I can produce SPARQL queries to sample synsets, lemmas and relations so you (or I) can manually inspect correctness for a representative sample.
3. Compare against a gold standard
   - Compare RDF triples to the canonical Princeton WordNet release (or another authoritative snapshot). Compute precision/recall for senses, lemma forms, and relations (hypernym, antonym, etc.).
4. Run focused automated checks
   - Validate labels, datatypes, POS tags, synset IDs, and relation types.
   - Check for missing/incorrect language tags, malformed literals, and broken URIs.
5. Run broader QA
   - Check provenance (are identifiers persistent?), canonicalization (are sense IDs stable?), and consistency of relations (e.g., cycles where there shouldn’t be any).
6. Report actionable findings
   - For any discrepancies found, produce examples (triples) that show the problem and recommend fixes.

If you want, I can:
- Run (write) example SPARQL queries to sample synsets and relations from the W3C WordNet RDF URL you provided.
- Draft a comparison plan or an evaluation script you can run to compute precision/recall against the Princeton WordNet files.
- Help interpret any sample mismatches you find.

Which would you prefer: (A) a short SPARQL query to fetch sample synsets/lemmas from the W3C WordNet RDF, (B) a plan/script to compare the RDF against Princeton WordNet as gold standard, or (C) a manual checklist you can follow to validate accuracy?

IR_5,What is the trust value of the Linked Open Camera dataset?,0.5,"The trust value for the Linked Open Camera dataset (bpr) is 0.50 (50%).
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
IR_5,How trustworthy is the Linked Open Camera dataset?,0.5,"Short answer: moderately trustworthy — useful but with important caveats.

Why: the bpr (Linked Open Camera) dataset shows a mix of strengths and weaknesses in the measured indicators.

Key metrics (selected):
- Overall Trust value: 0.50 (neutral / medium).
- Believability: 0.50.
- Reputation: very low (≈ 0.000008).
- Verifiability: low (0.11) → provenance and source traces are limited.
- Accuracy: reported as 1.00 (latest measurement) — suggests good correctness in sampled checks, but other quality issues remain.
- Security score: 1.00 (strong).
- Representational-consistency: 0.876 (high — good use of common representations).
- Consistency (data-level): ~0.499 (moderate; some internal inconsistencies).
- Completeness: 0.0 (many expected data elements are missing).
- Interlinking completeness / degree of connection: 0.0 (very little linking to other datasets).
- Availability: downloadable RDF dumps are provided (many URLs) and a SPARQL endpoint is available (http://dati.camera.it/sparql). Requires authentication: False. Use HTTPS: True.

Implications for use
- Good for structural/technical use: strong security, good representational consistency, and readily downloadable RDF dumps + working SPARQL endpoint make it convenient to query and integrate.
- Not a stand-alone authoritative source for sensitive or critical facts: low verifiability and reputation, plus very low completeness and interlinking, mean you should not rely on it as the sole provenance for crucial decisions.
- Quality is mixed: accuracy checks are positive (sampled), but moderate internal consistency and flagged problems (e.g., ontology-hijacking reported) mean you should validate results on a per-use basis.

Practical recommendations
- If you plan to use it in production or for high-stakes decisions: cross-check important facts against authoritative sources; store provenance of extracted facts.
- For analytics or enrichment: okay as a structural/internal resource (schema and labels), but augment with linking to external datasets to improve context.
- For improving trust: the dataset would benefit from better metadata about sources/provenance (to raise verifiability), increased interlinking, and registering/communicating authoritative publisher credentials (to raise reputation).

If you want, I can:
- produce a short summary table of the main metrics,
- show the download/SPARQL URLs found,
- or suggest exact SPARQL checks/queries to validate particular facts. Which would you prefer?

TA_1,Is the number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint always the same?,"No, they slightly increase over time.","No — the triple count retrieved from the NoiPA SPARQL endpoint changes over time. Recorded values (Number of triples (query)) are:

- 2025-05-04: 412,894,535  
- 2025-07-13: 432,861,574  (+19,967,039 vs May)

(For comparison, the ""Number of triples (metadata)"" measure is reported as 340,000,000 and stays constant — that is a separate metadata count.)

These increases indicate the dataset is being updated. If you want to check current counts yourself, run a SPARQL count query such as:
SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?triples) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
TA_1,The number of triples of NoiPA retrieved via the SPARQL endpoint is constant?,"No, they slightly increase over time.","No — the triple count returned by the SPARQL endpoint is not constant. It increases over time:

Overall (2025-05-04 → 2025-09-07): +33,275,522 triples (~+8.06%).

Note: a separate ""Number of triples (metadata)"" value is constant at 340,000,000 in your records — that appears to be a metadata field and does not match the live SPARQL query counts above. Also the dataset shows historical updates, so the growing query counts are consistent with data being updated.

TA_2,Is the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP always available?,Yes,"Short answer: No — not guaranteed always. The DBLP SPARQL endpoint is usually up, but availability has varied in recent checks.

Evidence from your measurements
- SPARQL endpoint URL: https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql
- Recorded ""Sparql endpoint = Available"" on 2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03 and 2025-09-07.
- Availability score (sampled):
  - 2025-05-04: 0.975
  - 2025-07-13 / 2025-08-03: 1.00
  - 2025-09-07: 0.75 (drop in availability)
- Performance indicators (examples): median latency ~0.1–0.2 s; throughput ~6–8 req/s.
- Some checks flagged issues (e.g., ""inactive links"" True on one 2025-09-07 entry), and metadata shows the endpoint does not require authentication.

What this means
- The endpoint is generally reliable (was successfully reachable in multiple checks and shows good latency), but it has experienced intermittent degradation/outages (the availability score drop and inactive-links flag).
- Because availability can change, you should not assume 100% uptime for production-critical workflows.

Practical recommendations
- Before running long or critical jobs, perform a light connectivity/health check against https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql.
- Implement retries and exponential backoff for queries.
- Cache results when appropriate to avoid repeated load and dependency on real-time availability.
- Use the RDF dumps as a fallback for heavy/batch processing:
  - https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples
  - https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz
- If you need to report persistent outages or get more details, contact the maintainers recorded in the metadata (example contact: Marcel R. Ackermann — marcel.ackermann@dagstuhl.de / mra@dagstuhl.de).

If you want, I can:
- run a live check (if you provide access) and report current status, or
- provide a short health-check script you can run before jobs to verify the endpoint is reachable and responsive.

TA_2,Is the DBLP SPARQL endpoint always up?,Yes,"Short answer: No guarantee it's ""always"" up, but in the monitoring logs you supplied the DBLP SPARQL endpoint (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql) was reported as Available on every check on 2025-05-04, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03 and 2025-09-07. Latency in those checks was low (median ~100–200 ms) and throughput/availability metrics were generally good, though an availability score dropped to 0.75 on 2025-09-07 (indicating some intermittent issues around that time).

What that means
- The endpoint has been reachable on the sampled dates, and performance looks healthy in those checks.
- “Always up” cannot be guaranteed from a few periodic checks — availability can change between checks (transient outages, maintenance, rate-limits, network issues, etc.).

How you can check right now
- Quick SPARQL test (HTTP GET):  
  curl -s -G --data-urlencode ""query=SELECT (1 AS ?ok) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 1"" -H ""Accept: application/sparql-results+json"" https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql
  - A valid JSON results response indicates the endpoint is responding to queries.
- Simple HTTP HEAD to test server reachability:  
  curl -I https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql

Monitoring recommendations
- Use continuous uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom, Healthchecks, or a small cron job) that runs a small SELECT/ASK periodically (e.g. every minute or 5 minutes) and alerts on failures.
- Respect polite query patterns (small test queries, reasonable frequency) to avoid hitting rate limits.
- Log response times and error codes so you can spot degradations (availability score drops like the one on 2025-09-07).

If you want, I can:
- Run a live check for you now (if you permit a network check), or
- Provide a small monitoring script (bash or Python) you can deploy to track the endpoint and alert on failures.

TA_3,Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always set to 1 in the observed period?,"No, it is discontinuous","Short answer: No.

Details:
- The metadata flag ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" is set to 1.0 in the May–August 2025 snapshots (2025-05-04, 2025-06-01, 2025-07-13, 2025-08-03).
- But the query-level flag ""Availability of RDF dump (query)"" is False in those same snapshots (e.g. 2025-05-04 / 2025-06-01 / 2025-07-13 / 2025-08-03).

So the dataset's metadata reports a dump is available, but the query-level availability is not. There are also explicit offline dump URLs listed (ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/... ), so a dump exists even though the ""query"" availability flag is False.
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
TA_3,Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?,"No, it is discontinuous","Short answer: No — the Allie RDF dump is not reliably always up.

What the checks show
- Offline dump(s) exist: ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz (recorded in the metadata).
- However, automated availability checks returned the dump as unavailable/inactive at several timestamps:
  - ""Availability for download (query)"" = False (multiple dates).
  - ""Inactive links"" = True (checks on 2025-06/07/08/09 show inactive links).
  - ""Availability of a common accepted Media Type"" / availability score dropped to very low (0.0) in recent metadata checks.
- The site and SPARQL endpoint are published:
  - Website: http://allie.dbcls.jp/
  - SPARQL endpoint: http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql
  These are useful alternatives when a dump is not downloadable.

Practical recommendations
- If you need a local copy, try the FTP dump URL directly (may be intermittent):
  - ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz
  - Use an FTP-capable tool (curl, wget, lftp) and retry if the connection fails.
- Use the SPARQL endpoint for programmatic access if the dump is unavailable:
  - http://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql
- Automate availability monitoring (example):
  - Periodically curl -I or wget the FTP/HTTP URL and alert on failures.
  - Periodically run a small SPARQL ASK query against the endpoint to confirm it responds.
- Contact/support:
  - Listed contact: Database Center for Life Science — info AT dbcls.rois.ac.jp (replace AT with @).
  - If dumps are important for your workflow, ask them about mirrors or an API/cron schedule.

If you want, I can:
- Try the current status of the FTP URL and SPARQL endpoint now and report the live result (I can only do simulated checks if you want commands to run on your machine).
- Provide example curl/wget/lftp and SPARQL queries and a simple monitoring script.

E&D_1,Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Short answer: because all of the availability sub‑metrics that the Availability score aggregates are satisfied for dblp-kg (working access points + metadata and download information present and registered), so the linear combination of those sub‑scores reaches the maximum (1.0).

Notes about other related metrics
- Some access-related flags are negative or not applicable (e.g., Availability of RDF dump (query) = False; Use HTTPS = False), but those particular checks either have low or no weight in the Availability dimension or are not sufficient to offset the many positive availability indicators.
- The Availability score is described as a linear combination of individual availability metric scores, so when the core availability metrics (working access point, metadata availability, download metadata, registration) are all 1.0 the combined result is 1.0.

If you want, I can:
- show a breakdown of the Availability score computation (which metrics are included and their contribution), or
- highlight which negative items are keeping other dimensions (e.g., Security or Understandability) from improving.
",0,0,0.5,,0,,,,,,
E&D_1,Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?,Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed,"Short answer: because the DBLP KG exposes working access points and metadata that satisfy the availability checks used to compute that metric.

What supports the score = 1 (examples from the measurements you provided)
- A1-D Working access point(s) = 1.0 (operational access point)
- SPARQL endpoint = Available (SPARQL endpoint URL: https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql)
- F3-M Data referrable via a DOI = 1.0
- A1-M / F2a-M / R1.3-M metadata availability flags = 1.0 (metadata is retrievable and described with VoID/DCAT predicates)
- Availability for download (metadata) = 1.0 and Availability of RDF dump (metadata) = 1.0 (metadata declares downloadable dumps)
- Dataset URL present (https://dblp.org) and download URLs recorded: https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz
- License retrievable (machine-readable CC0 / opendefinition link present)
- Performance / responsiveness measures (performance score, throughput/latency) are good (performance score = 1.0)

Why there can be apparent contradictions
- Some low-level checks that require actually fetching data at query time show different values: Availability for download (query) = False and Availability of RDF dump (query) = False in some timestamps, while metadata-based checks report dumps available. That usually means the metadata or VoID/landing page advertises a dump and other access points exist (so availability-by-metadata = true), but a live automated fetch or a specific query used by the checker failed (temporary network error, redirect handling, compressed files, permission/robots, or the checker’s specific download test did not match the dump location).
- In short: the availability score is based on presence of working access points and metadata (which DBLP satisfies), not only on a single ad-hoc download test.

If you want
- I can list the exact supporting measures and timestamps used to compute the availability score, or
- I can attempt to re-check the specific download URLs (or explain why the automated query tests might have failed).

E&D_2,Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?,"No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Short answer: No — an ""Amount of data score"" of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset file is empty. It means the dataset scored the minimum on that quality dimension (according to the measurement rules used), but there are several reasons that can produce a zero score besides the dataset actually containing zero triples.

Why a 0 can appear (examples)
- The counted metrics used to compute the score are zero (e.g., number of triples accessible via the SPARQL endpoint, number of entities, number of labels). That really does mean little or no accessible data.
- The metrics could not be retrieved (SPARQL endpoint down, access blocked, missing metadata), and the scoring implementation treats missing/failed checks as zero.
- The score is a normalized combination of multiple submetrics and may be 0 because one or more required submetrics are missing or below threshold, even though some data exist (for example a dataset with only metadata but no queryable triples).
- Different outputs in the logs (None, -, absent, empty lists) differentiate “couldn’t measure” from “measured as zero.” A reported 0.000000 is a computed value; None or ""-"" usually indicates the measurement was not available.

How to confirm whether the dataset is really empty
1. Check whether a SPARQL endpoint is available and reachable (HTTP status 200). If there’s no endpoint, amount metrics often become unavailable or default to 0.
2. Run a direct triple-count query against the endpoint:
   - COUNT all triples:
     SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?count) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }
   - Count distinct subjects/entities (approximate entities):
     SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?s) AS ?entities) WHERE { ?s a ?type }
   If these return 0 (and the query executes), the dataset is effectively empty at the endpoint.
3. Check metadata / VoID / dumps:
   - Look for VoID/dataset metadata that gives triple counts or a downloadable RDF dump. If a dump exists, download a sample or run a local triple count.
4. Sample data query:
   - SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10
   If this returns rows, there is data accessible even if the amount-of-data score is 0.
5. Inspect log fields that indicate measurement failure (None, ""absent"", ""-"" or errors). If the measurement failed, the 0 score may be the fallback.

- If you want, tell me the dataset name or its SPARQL endpoint (or paste the relevant lines from your logs) and I can suggest the exact queries/steps to verify counts and interpret the specific measurements.

E&D_2,"If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?","No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.","Not necessarily. The ""Amount of data score"" is a computed metric (a linear combination of several lower-level amount metrics) that ranges 0–1. A value of 0 only tells you the computed score is zero — it does not by itself prove “there are no triples”.

Common reasons a 0 score can occur
- The dataset really is empty (no triples). In that case raw counts like ""Number of triples (query)"" or ""Number of triples (metadata)"" will be 0 or show no results.
- The evaluation lacked the information needed to compute amount metrics (missing or inaccessible SPARQL endpoint, absent VoID/metadata, or query errors). Some lower-level metrics may return “-”/None and the aggregator may treat that as zero or produce a zero final score.
- All underlying amount metrics returned very low/zero values (e.g., no labeled entities, no linked triples), so the linear combination evaluates to 0.
- A configuration/measurement bug or normalization choice in the evaluation pipeline (e.g., strict thresholds) that drives the aggregated score to 0 even though the dataset contains some data.

How to check which case applies (quick checklist)
1. Inspect raw amount metrics for that dataset:
   - Number of triples (query), Number of triples (metadata)
   - Number of labels/comments present on the data
   - Number of entities, Number of blank nodes
2. Check availability metadata:
   - Is a SPARQL endpoint reachable?
   - Is there a downloadable RDF dump or a VoID file?
3. Look for “missing”/error markers in the records (None, -, absent, False). Those indicate the measurement could not run.
4. Try a direct test yourself:
   - Run a simple COUNT query on the SPARQL endpoint (SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?c) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }).
   - If no endpoint, download the dump (if available) and count triples with an RDF tool.

If you want, tell me the dataset name(s) with score 0 from your list and I’ll check the relevant raw metrics shown in your data and say whether the zero likely means “no data” or “measurement/missing metadata” and suggest fixes.

E&D_3,"When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?",Yes,"Short answer: Not always.

Explanation:
- An availability score of 1 means that the tool found all the availability-related checks it uses to be satisfied — i.e. the contributing sub‑metrics (working access point(s), metadata saying a dump exists, registration in search engines, etc.) all reached their maximum.  
- However, those checks can come from different sources: some tests verify an actual, working SPARQL endpoint, some only check metadata/VoID that claims a dump exists, and some check registration in searchable engines. So a score of 1 usually means the dataset meets the availability criteria the checker expects, but it does not automatically guarantee both (a) a live, responsive SPARQL endpoint and (b) a downloadable RDF dump are actually reachable in every case — especially when the checker relied on metadata rather than live download tests.

How to be sure (quick checks you can run)
1. Verify the SPARQL endpoint is live:
   - Example ASK (curl):
     curl -G ""https://YOUR-ENDPOINT/sparql"" \
       --data-urlencode 'query=ASK { ?s ?p ?o }' \
       -H 'Accept: application/sparql-results+json'
   - A 200 response with true/false JSON (or other SPARQL result) = endpoint responsive.

2. Verify a dump is downloadable:
   - HEAD or GET the dump URL:
     curl -I ""https://example.org/path/to/dump.ttl.gz""
   - Look for HTTP 200 (or 3xx redirect) and a content-type typical for RDF (text/turtle, application/rdf+xml, application/n-triples, application/trig, application/ld+json, or a gzip of those).

3. Verify metadata/VoID (if present) matches reality:
   - Fetch the VoID/DCAT entry and check void:dataset/void:triples and void:uriLookupLocation or dcat:downloadURL, then try those URLs.

4. Check security/auth requirements:
   - See whether the endpoint or dump requires authentication or HTTPS (some metrics indicate this).

If you tell me the dataset name (or the specific availability metrics you see), I can interpret the exact sub‑metrics for that dataset and tell you whether both a live SPARQL endpoint and a working dump were actually verified.
",0,0,0,,0,,,,,,
E&D_3,"if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?",Yes,"Short answer: Not necessarily.

What ""availability score = 1"" means
- The availability score is a composite (linear combination) of several availability sub‑metrics (e.g. SPARQL endpoint reachable, an RDF dump advertised in metadata, downloadable dump URLs, VoID/DCAT metadata present, etc.). A value of 1 means the combined availability metrics used in the score reached the maximum possible value given the scoring weights.
- It does NOT automatically guarantee that every single access point (both a live SPARQL endpoint AND a downloadable RDF dump) are currently up and serving data unless those specific sub‑metrics are part of the composite and have each been checked as successful.

Why you should check individual measures
- The score can be driven by metadata claims (e.g. VoID says a dump exists) even if the dump is offline.
- Different datasets/tools weight sub‑metrics differently, so a score of 1 could reflect that all required (or heavily weighted) availability criteria are satisfied while other optional ones are not.
- Some measures distinguish metadata availability from actual downloadable dumps (e.g. ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" vs ""Availability of RDF dump (query)"").

How to confirm both are up (recommended quick checks)
1. Check the SPARQL endpoint:
   - Simple HTTP HEAD or GET:
     curl -I 'https://your-sparql-endpoint/sparql'
   - Run a small SPARQL ASK to confirm it responds:
     curl -sG --data-urlencode 'query=ASK { ?s ?p ?o }' -H 'Accept: application/sparql-results+json' 'https://your-sparql-endpoint/sparql'
   - Expect HTTP 200 and a JSON boolean result for the ASK.
2. Check the RDF dump(s):
   - Look up the dump URLs in metadata/VoID (fields like ""Offline dumps"" or ""URL for download the dataset"").
   - Test reachability:
     curl -I 'https://example.org/dataset.nt.gz'   (or wget --spider)
   - If HEAD succeeds (HTTP 200), try downloading a small portion (range request) to confirm file serves.
3. Verify metadata vs actual availability:
   - Compare ""Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"" and ""Availability of RDF dump (query)"" (or equivalent measures). If metadata says a dump exists but the query/check fails, the dump may be offline.
4. Check security/HTTPS/auth:
   - Ensure endpoint supports HTTPS and whether authentication is required (some endpoints require API keys or login).

If you want, tell me the dataset name or the endpoint/dump URLs you care about and I can run through the specific checks (what to curl/query and what to expect).

E&D_4,"if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","Short answer: No.

Explanation and next steps:
- The metric/value ""R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source"" = 1 only means a license is explicitly indicated and retrievable from the dataset's primary metadata (VoID, dataset page, SPARQL endpoint, etc.). It does not say anything about the terms of that license (whether it is ""open"", permissive, or restrictive).
- To decide if the license is an open license you must inspect the actual license identifier/URL and interpret its terms. Common machine-readable license URIs in your logs (examples you have) include:
  - http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero  (CC0 — open/public domain)
  - http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by     (CC BY — open, requires attribution)
  - http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa  (CC BY‑SA — open, share‑alike)
  - https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ (CC0)
  - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/      (CC BY 4.0)
  - https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0       (Apache-2.0 — open, permissive)
  These examples include open licences (CC0, CC BY, Apache 2.0, CC BY‑SA). But other license URIs could point to closed/proprietary or restricted licenses.
- Practical checklist to determine openness:
  1. Extract the license value from metadata (dcterms:license, void:license, schema:license, etc.).
  2. Normalize it to a canonical identifier if possible (SPDX ID or OpenDefinition URI).
  3. Check whether the license is listed as Open Definition / OSI / SPDX and whether it permits reuse, redistribution, modification, and commercial use (and whether it requires attribution or share‑alike).
  4. If the license is ambiguous (custom terms, no machine-readable ref, or a human‑readable page with unclear clauses), treat it as non‑open until clarified or seek legal advice.
- Automatable approach: match license URIs/strings against a whitelist of known open licenses (SPDX list or Open Definition list). If matched → likely open. If not → manual review.

If you want, I can:
- scan the license values you have and mark which are open vs not (using SPDX/OpenDefinition);
- provide a simple script/pseudocode to map license URIs to SPDx IDs and openness.
",1,1,1,,1,,,,,,
E&D_4,"If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?","No, it means that a license is specified","No — a license metric value of 1 simply means a license was found and is retrievable (machine- or human-readable) from the primary source. It does NOT by itself mean the license is ""open"" or that reuse is unrestricted.

What to check to determine openness
- Inspect the license URI or text returned (e.g. https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/, https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0, http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by).  
- Compare that license to an authoritative list of open licenses (Open Definition / SPDX). Licenses approved by the Open Definition (CC0, CC-BY, Apache 2.0, OGL, etc.) are considered open; non-commercial, no-derivatives, or otherwise restrictive terms (e.g. CC BY-NC) are not open.
- If you need machine checks, map license URIs against an ""open"" whitelist (Open Definition list or SPDX IDs).

Examples from your data
- Found licenses in metadata: Apache-2.0, CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, OGL — these are generally considered open (CC-BY-SA is open but copyleft/share‑alike).
- A dataset with R1.1 = 1 may still use a restrictive license if the URI points to a restrictive license, so confirm by inspecting the license URI.

If you want, I can:
- Parse the license URIs present in your dataset list and mark which are open vs. non-open according to Open Definition/SPDX.
- Provide a small script or mapping table you can run to automatically classify license URIs.

E&D_5,"If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?",Yes,"Short answer: No.

Explanation:
- A verifiability score of 1 means ""all the verifiability metrics that the evaluation measures are satisfied"" — i.e., every submetric that contributes to the verifiability dimension is maximized in that particular scoring system.
- It does NOT automatically mean every possible piece of provider information (all contact details, all contributors, inclusion on every trusted list, extra provenance records, etc.) has been provided — only that the specific verifiability checks used by the tool are fulfilled.

What those checks typically include
- machine- or human‑readable license available (R1.1)
- author/publisher/contributor metadata present (Author (metadata), Publisher, Contributor)
- license present in metadata or VoID (machine‑readable license)
- dataset/VoID URL discoverable
- provenance/source statements (Sources)
- dataset signed / cryptographic metadata (if measured)
- presence of a VoID/DCAT description or working primary metadata sources

Why you might still be missing provider details
- The scorer may treat some fields as optional or weight them lightly (so a dataset could reach 1 without e.g. an email address if other fields are present).
- Some provider information (like being listed on an external “trusted providers” registry) is often measured under a different dimension (believability/trust/reputation), not verifiability.

If you want
- I can list the exact verifiability submetrics your tool uses, or
- I can inspect a specific dataset’s metric breakdown and tell you which provider fields are missing and what to add to reach verifiability = 1.
",0.5,0,0.5,,"0.5",,,,,,
E&D_5,"If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?",Yes,"Short answer: No — not necessarily.

Why: the ""verifiability score"" is a computed, weighted aggregate of whatever verifiability checks your system runs (author/publisher present, machine‑readable license, sources listed, signed, on trusted list, etc.). A score of 1 means ""all the verifiability checks that the evaluator measures (and weights) passed at the maximum"", but it does not automatically guarantee every possible piece of provider information exists, is complete, or is correct.

Concrete caveats
- Scope: the score only covers the specific metrics included in the computation. If some provider fields are not part of the metric set, they can be missing even though the score is 1.
- Granularity: a metric may treat a field as present if any value exists (e.g., an email string), but that value could be incomplete or incorrect.
- Machine vs human readable: a metric might count a license as present even if only a human‑readable text is given and not a machine‑readable URI.
- Trust vs presence: presence of a provider name ≠ verification that the provider is actually trustworthy or that contact details are valid.
- Possible false positives: metadata can be present but stale or misleading (e.g., placeholder emails). The aggregated score cannot detect all such problems.

How you can be sure ""all provider information is available""
- Check the specific verifiability metrics used and their definitions/weights.
- Inspect the metadata for these key items and ensure each is complete and machine‑readable:
  - dcterms:creator / foaf:maker / schema:author — name, affiliation, email
  - dcterms:publisher / schema:publisher — name, homepage
  - dcterms:source / prov:wasDerivedFrom — original sources
  - dcterms:license / cc:license — machine‑readable license URI
  - landing page / contactPoint / maintainer / provenance info
  - digital identifiers (DOI) and signatures (if applicable)
- If you have a SPARQL endpoint you can run simple checks. Example queries:
  - Authors: SELECT ?creator ?name ?email WHERE { ?d dcterms:creator ?creator . OPTIONAL { ?creator foaf:name ?name; foaf:mbox ?email } } LIMIT 10
  - Publisher: SELECT ?pub ?name WHERE { ?d dcterms:publisher ?pub . OPTIONAL { ?pub foaf:name ?name } } LIMIT 10
  - License: SELECT ?lic WHERE { ?d dcterms:license ?lic } LIMIT 5
  - VoID/DCAT metadata: SELECT ?p ?o WHERE { ?dataset a void:Dataset . ?dataset ?p ?o } LIMIT 50

If you want, tell me which dataset (or a verifiability score report) and I can:
- show which verifiability checks were used to compute the score, and
- list exactly which provider fields are present/missing so you can decide whether the dataset truly has ""all provider information"".
